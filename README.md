# index_generator

This is the result of my final project for the AllWomen DS bootcamp. The aim of this project was to explore whether it is possible to automatically generate the analytic index (sometimes called "back-of-the-book index) of academic book.

Analytic indices are typically found at the end of books and contain an alphabetized list of important concepts/names found in the book with references of the pages where they can be found. They also contain some information about relations of similarity between different keywords as well as lists of secondary keywords (deriving from a main keyword).

These indices are present in practically all academic books and they make their reading much easier while also providing a very exhaustive overview of the contents of the book. Their development is, nevertheless, very time consuming and a rather tedious task (I know this first hand, since some years ago I was asked to make one: https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/bbm%3A978-1-137-47251-9%2F1.pdf), so, although some may find this controversial, I think it would be good to automatize it.
