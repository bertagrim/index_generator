5,A further narrowing of the term is also commonly made in separating the study of semantics from that of pragmatics.,19,1,1 Introduction,No info,No info,term study semantics pragmatic

9,"These central concerns of semantic theory, adapted from Kempson (1977:4), are stated in (1) and may be adopted as criteria for ascertaining the adequacy of semantic theories which apply in addition to the general conditions on scientific theories of falsifiability and rigour.",19,1,1 Introduction,No info,No info,central concern semantic theory kempson criterion adequacy semantic theory addition general condition scientific theory falsifiability rigour
10,"A semantic theory must: capture for any language the nature of the meaning of words, phrases and sentences and explain the nature of the relation between them; be able to predict the ambiguities in the expressions of a language; characterise and explain the systematic meaning relations between the words, the phrases and the sentences of a language.",19,1,1 Introduction,No info,No info,semantic theory language nature word phrase sentence nature relation able predict ambiguity expression language systematic meaning relation word phrase sentence language
11,One may add to these the condition that a semantic theory should provide an account of the relation between linguistic expressions and what may be called 'things in the world'.,19,1,1 Introduction,No info,No info,condition semantic theory account relation linguistic expression world
12,"In other words, it is a primary concern of a semantic theory to explain how human beings can use their language to convey information about the external world.",19,1,1 Introduction,No info,No info,word primary concern semantic theory human use language convey information external world
13,We may thus require a semantic theory to conform also to the criterion of adequacy in (2).,19,1,1 Introduction,No info,No info,semantic theory conform criterion adequacy

18,This theory is a formal theory of semantics and is distinguished from general linguistic semantics by its greater use of mathematical techniques and reliance on logical precision.,20,2,1 Introduction,No info,No info,theory formal theory semantics general linguistic semantics greater mathematical technique reliance logical precision
19,This is not to say that formal semantics and general linguistic semantics are completely separate disciplines.,20,2,1 Introduction,No info,No info,formal semantics general linguistic semantics separate discipline
20,"It sometimes appears that these two approaches to the semantics of natural languages are mutually incompatible, but this is not obviously true.",20,2,1 Introduction,No info,No info,approach semantics natural language incompatible true
21,The former draws heavily on the long tradition of research in the latter which in turn benefits from the greater precision of the former.,20,2,1 Introduction,No info,No info,former long tradition research latter turn benefit greater precision former
22,Both approaches enable us to understand more about meaning and greater integration between them would doubtless bring greater benefits to the discipline.,20,2,1 Introduction,No info,No info,approach enable understand meaning greater integration greater benefit discipline

32,"Owing to the relatively recent application of the tools of formal semantics to the analysis of natural languages, however, there are many topics in linguistic semantics that have not yet been formally analysed, but it is hoped that ultimately a good deal of linguistic meaning will be amenable to the sort of rigorous treatment envisaged by Montague.",20,2,1 Introduction,No info,No info,recent application tool formal semantics analysis natural language many topic linguistic semantics good deal linguistic amenable sort rigorous treatment montague
33,"It is the exposition of Montague's theory in its now classical form that constitutes the subject matter of this book, but, before the main points of his semantic theory are introduced, the four criteria of adequacy in (1) and (2) above will be discussed in more detail in order to provide a clearer idea of the fundamental issues that underlie the development of the theory in later chapters.",20,2,1 Introduction,No info,No info,exposition montague theory classical form subject matter book main point semantic theory criterion adequacy detail order clearer idea fundamental issue underlie development theory chapter

80,"Indeed, the concept of syntax as a bridge between phonology and semantics, current in many grammatical theories, would seem to require that all constituents be assigned a meaning by the semantics and, furthermore, that (surface) syntactic structure should directly determine how the meanings of sentences are derived.",22,4,1 Introduction,No info,No info,concept syntax bridge phonology semantics current many grammatical theory constituent meaning semantics syntactic structure sentence
