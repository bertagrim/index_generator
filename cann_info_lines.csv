0,This book provides a clear and accessible introduction to formal semantics within a linguistic framework.,1,I,,,
1,"It presupposes no previous background in logic, but takes students step-by-step from simple predicate/argument structures and their interpretation through to Montague's intensional logic, bringing them to a level where they can tackle the primary technical literature.",1,I,,,
2,"It assumes some basic knowledge of linguistics, but aims to be as non-technical as possible within a technical subject.",1,I,,,
3,"Formal semantics will be welcomed by students and researchers in linguistics, artificial intelligence and cognitive science alike.",1,I,,,

204,PREFACE,13,XIII,PREFACE,,
205,"Although billed as an introduction to formal semantics in general, this textbook is concerned primarily with what has come to be called Montague Semantics and is therefore based primarily on Montague (1970a; 1970b; 1973).",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
206,"A good deal of research within Montague's general framework has been carried out since the 1970s and this has led to many changes in, and many variations of, the original theory.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
207,Other research has also led to reactions to Montague's programme and the development of rival theories.,13,XIII,PREFACE,,
208,"Only a few of these revisions and extensions to Montague's theory have, however, found their way into the text of the book.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
209,"This may seem retrogressive, but it is my conviction that many of the questions being asked in formal semantics and the directions of research are best understood by learning about the more radical elements of Montague's original approach, particularly the semantic analysis of noun phrases and the theory of intensionality.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
210,"Once these have been grasped, later developments can be understood more easily.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
211,"For this reason, the exposition develops an account of the now classical version of Montague's theory, but references are given for the major revisions and extensions at the end of each chapter for readers to pursue as their interests dictate.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
212,"Furthermore, there is no attempt in this book to give more of the logical and mathematical background than is necessary to understand how such things can help in the analysis of the semantics of natural languages.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
213,"This is not an introduction to formal semantics for logicians, but for linguists.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
214,"No discussion of completeness, consistency, formal proofs, or axiomatisation will therefore be found in these pages.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
215,This book thus provides an introduction to certain techniques in formal semantics as applied to natural languages (exemplified by English).,13,XIII,PREFACE,,
216,"Although readers may find that the domain of meaning that appears to be amenable to the sort of semantic analysis discussed in this book is somewhat small, the fundamental ideas of truth-conditional semantics and the possibility of applying the techniques of formal semantics to natural languages remain important for the development of linguistic semantics.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
217,"As an introduction, no logical or mathematical background is assumed for the reader, but some knowledge of Linguistics is taken for granted, particularly with regard to syntax, but acquaintance with an introductory book in general linguistic semantics would be helpful.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
218,"An explanation of all the relevant concepts from logic and set theory is, however, provided within the text, and references to other textbooks that deal with these concepts are given in the further reading sections of each chapter.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
219,"Readers who have a knowledge of basic predicate logic may skip Chapters 2 and 3, but those who do not are advised to take each chapter in turn.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
220,"It is, moreover, advisable to attempt the exercises as they come along, provided that the reader does not get stuck on them.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
221,It is better to move on to the rest of the text than to spend many fruitless hours struggling over a single problem (in the exercises or in the reading).,13,XIII,PREFACE,,
222,"The answers to some of these exercises appear at the end of the book, but none are given for those that have an asterisk in front of them.",13,XIII,PREFACE,,
223,These latter are in the nature of research exercises designed to make readers consider some of the sorts of problems and difficulties that are encountered in providing formal semantic analyses of the xiii,13,XIII,PREFACE,,
224,sentences of a natural language.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
225,"References to particular solutions to some of these exercises may, however, be found in the further reading.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
226,This project began as a joint venture between myself and Lesley Stirling.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
227,"Unfortunately, circumstances conspired against our co-authorship and the final text was written entirely by myself.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
228,"Lesley wrote an early draft of Chapter 1 and some notes for Chapter 8 and, while none of her original text appears in this final version, her ideas in our early discussions have obviously influenced its final shape.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
229,Co-teaching with her in 1986/7 also influenced the way that my later courses in formal semantics developed and thus ultimately how certain of the topics in this book are presented.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
230,"For these, alas now unidentifiable, benefits, she has my heartfelt thanks.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
231,My thanks also go to John Lyons who acted as a very careful editor.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
232,This book has benefited greatly from his meticulous notes on the manuscript and his numerous criticisms of substance and style and his positive suggestions have helped to improve the text considerably.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
233,"I also wish to thank my colleagues Jim Hurford and Jim Miller, for their many comments on earlier versions of the text.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
234,Chapter 8 benefited greatly from the latter's careful comments.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
235,Thanks also to Ruth Kempson for her comments on the earliest text written by myself and Lesley Stirling and to Marguerite Nesling for her insightful comments on the philosophical aspects of the text.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
236,"The book has grown out of a series of courses in formal semantics for undergraduate and first year postgraduate students and I have to thank all the students at Edinburgh University, too numerous to mention by name, who took the Advanced Semantics class between the academic years 1986/7 and 1991/2.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
237,Their vociferous suffering over the numerous typos of the various versions of the text and their confusion at wrong diagrams and impossibly difficult exercises inspired me to change things well after the time that I thought I had a finished version.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
238,The text is the better for their complaints.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
239,"None of those mentioned here are, of course, responsible for any remaining mistakes or infelicities for which the computer is entirely to blame.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
240,Judith Ayling and her staff at Cambridge University Press have my gratitude for their careful editing of the final text and their considerable help with the preparation of the camara ready copy from which this book is printed.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
241,Robert,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
242,"Bradford helped a good deal with the latter stages of the production of the text, the final version of which was prepared on a NeXTstation.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
243,Many thanks too to Fiona Chapman who heroically produced the illustrations while simultaneously building a house and looking after three children.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
244,Thanks also to Tom and Betty Watson for endless gin and sympathy and to those people in the village who were continually surprised that I had still not finished the book.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,
245,"Finally, my thanks to Robert Bradford for all his help and support, emotional, financial and computational.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
246,"His help in solving the repetitive tasks in word-processing and his patience in listening to endless rantings about logic, time and the meaning of meaning went far beyond the realms of duty.",14,XIV,PREFACE,,
247,I dedicate this book to him with my love.,14,XIV,PREFACE,,

322,Semantics and semantic theory,19,1,1 Introduction,,
323,"In its broadest sense, semantics is the study of meaning and linguistic semantics is the study of meaning as expressed by the words, phrases and sentences of human languages.",19,1,1 Introduction,,
324,"It is, however, more usual within linguistics to interpret the term more narrowly, as concerning the study of those aspects of meaning encoded in linguistic expressions that are independent of their use on particular occasions by particular individuals within a particular speech community.",19,1,1 Introduction,,
325,"In other words, semantics is the study of meaning abstracted away from those aspects that are derived from the intentions of speakers, their psychological states and the socio-cultural aspects of the context in which their utterances are made.",19,1,1 Introduction,,
326,A further narrowing of the term is also commonly made in separating the study of semantics from that of pragmatics.,19,1,1 Introduction,,
327,"Unfortunately, the nature of the object of inquiry of the discipline (what constitutes semantic meaning, as opposed to pragmatic meaning) and the domain of the inquiry",19,1,1 Introduction,,
328,(what aspects of meaning should be addressed by the discipline) remain difficult and controversial questions.,19,1,1 Introduction,,
329,"There are, however, three central aspects of the meaning of linguistic expressions that are currently accepted by most semanticists as forming the core concern of linguistic semantics.",19,1,1 Introduction,,
330,"These central concerns of semantic theory, adapted from Kempson (1977:4), are stated in (1) and may be adopted as criteria for ascertaining the adequacy of semantic theories which apply in addition to the general conditions on scientific theories of falsifiability and rigour.",19,1,1 Introduction,,
331,"A semantic theory must: capture for any language the nature of the meaning of words, phrases and sentences and explain the nature of the relation between them; be able to predict the ambiguities in the expressions of a language; characterise and explain the systematic meaning relations between the words, the phrases and the sentences of a language.",19,1,1 Introduction,,
332,One may add to these the condition that a semantic theory should provide an account of the relation between linguistic expressions and what may be called 'things in the world'.,19,1,1 Introduction,,
333,"In other words, it is a primary concern of a semantic theory to explain how human beings can use their language to convey information about the external world.",19,1,1 Introduction,,
334,We may thus require a semantic theory to conform also to the criterion of adequacy in (2).,19,1,1 Introduction,,
335,A semantic theory must provide an account of the relation between linguistic expressions and the things that they can be used to talk about.,19,1,1 Introduction,,
336,"There are many other aspects of meaning that can be included in the domain of linguistic semantics, but a theory conforming to the four criteria in (1) and (2) will cover the main ground of the discipline and provide a firm basis for further research.",19,1,1 Introduction,,
337,"In this book, we will be looking at a particular theory of semantics that goes a long way towards satisfying these criteria and that has been very influential in linguistic",19,1,1 Introduction,,
338,1 Introduction semantics over the last two decades.,20,2,1 Introduction,,
339,This theory is a formal theory of semantics and is distinguished from general linguistic semantics by its greater use of mathematical techniques and reliance on logical precision.,20,2,1 Introduction,,
340,This is not to say that formal semantics and general linguistic semantics are completely separate disciplines.,20,2,1 Introduction,,
341,"It sometimes appears that these two approaches to the semantics of natural languages are mutually incompatible, but this is not obviously true.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
342,The former draws heavily on the long tradition of research in the latter which in turn benefits from the greater precision of the former.,20,2,1 Introduction,,
343,Both approaches enable us to understand more about meaning and greater integration between them would doubtless bring greater benefits to the discipline.,20,2,1 Introduction,,
344,"Formal semantics itself was devised as a means of providing a precise interpretation for formal languages, i.e. the logical and mathematical languages that are opposed to natural languages that are spoken or written as the native languages of human beings.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
345,"Many logicians considered it to be impossible to apply the same rigour to the semantics of human languages, because of their supposedly inexact syntax, their vagueness and their ambiguity.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
346,"In the late nineteen-sixties, however, the philosopher Richard Montague asserted that it was possible to use the same techniques in analysing the meanings of sentences in English.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
347,"In three articles, English as a formal language, Universal grammar and The proper treatment of quantification in",20,2,1 Introduction,,
348,"English, all published or presented in 1970, Montague gave arguments for his hypothesis that:",20,2,1 Introduction,,
349,"There is in my opinion no important theoretical difference between natural languages and the artificial languages of logicians; indeed, I consider it possible to comprehend the syntax and semantics of both kinds of language within a single, natural and mathematically precise theory.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
350,Montague (1974: 222),20,2,1 Introduction,,
351,"Throughout the nineteen-seventies, after his tragic death in 1971, Montague's work had a radical effect on the study of semantics in linguistics.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
352,"Indeed, his ideas on the semantics of human languages have become central to the understanding of many of the questions and theories being discussed in linguistic semantics today.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
353,"Owing to the relatively recent application of the tools of formal semantics to the analysis of natural languages, however, there are many topics in linguistic semantics that have not yet been formally analysed, but it is hoped that ultimately a good deal of linguistic meaning will be amenable to the sort of rigorous treatment envisaged by Montague.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
354,"It is the exposition of Montague's theory in its now classical form that constitutes the subject matter of this book, but, before the main points of his semantic theory are introduced, the four criteria of adequacy in (1) and (2) above will be discussed in more detail in order to provide a clearer idea of the fundamental issues that underlie the development of the theory in later chapters.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
355,Compositionality,20,2,1 Introduction,,
356,A fundamental property that any semantic theory must have is the ability to pair the syntactic expressions of a language with their meanings.,20,2,1 Introduction,,
357,"In the first condition of adequacy in (l.a), above, this property is characterised as a requirement that a semantic theory account for the nature of the meaning of linguistic expressions and be able to pair every expression in a language (words, phrases and sentences) with an appropriate meaning.",20,2,1 Introduction,,
358,"As already mentioned, the characterisation of meaning is a",20,2,1 Introduction,,
359,"Semantics and semantic theory controversial matter, but whatever meanings are taken to be within a theory, it is obvious that there must be some way of associating them with appropriate linguistic expressions.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
360,"This is not a trivial matter, however, and there are a number of important points that need to be discussed with respect to this property.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
361,"In the first place, let us consider more closely what it is that is to be assigned meanings by a semantic theory.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
362,Condition (l.a) refers to words and sentences as the carriers of meaning.,21,3,1 Introduction,,
363,"The term sentence here is being used in its abstract sense, common in linguistics, as the largest unit of syntactic description, independently of its realisation in spoken or written texts.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
364,"Like the term sentence, word is also ambiguous in everyday English.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
365,"Within semantics, the notion of word that is most useful is that of the lexeme which is an abstract grammatical construct that underlies a set of word forms which are recognised as representatives of 'the same word' in different syntactic environments.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
366,"For example, the word forms sing, sings, singing, sang and sung are particular inflectional variants of a lexeme which we may represent for the time being as SING.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
367,"It is to lexemes and not to word forms that meanings should be assigned, because while the inflectional properties of the verb SING may vary in different syntactic environments, the sort of action described by the verb remains the same.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
368,"For this reason, the meaning of words is referred to in this book as lexical meaning, rather than word meaning.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
369,"Although it is possible for the meanings assigned to lexemes and sentences to be very different from each other, it is reasonable to expect the meanings of sentences to be related to the meanings of the lexemes underlying the word-forms they contain.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
370,It is intuitively implausible for there to be a language where the relation between the meaning of a sentence and the meanings of its component lexemes is entirely random.,21,3,1 Introduction,,
371,"While languages do contain idiomatic phrases and sentences where lexical and sentential meaning are not transparently related (e.g. kick the bucket meaning the same as DIE in English), this is never the general situation.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
372,"If there were no direct relation between lexical and sentential meaning, of course, the meaning of each sentence in a language would have to be listed.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
373,"Since the number of sentences that make up a language is infinite, this would mean that no human being would be able to determine the meanings of all the sentences of any language owing to the finite resources of the brain.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
374,"This is absurd, of course, and just as sentences are defined recursively by syntactic rules, taking words (or morphemes) as their basis, so their meanings should also be defined recursively from the meanings ascribed to the lexemes they contain.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
375,"Thus, in addition to associating each expression in a language with a meaning, an adequate semantic theory must also be able to explain how the meanings of smaller expressions contribute to the meanings of larger ones that contain them.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
376,A theory that derives the meaning of larger expressions from those of smaller ones is said to be compositional.,21,3,1 Introduction,,
377,"The Principle of Compositionaiity, given an initial definition in (3), is generally attributed to the German philosopher Gottlob Frege, and is thus sometimes referred to as the Fregean Principle of Compositionaiity or just the",21,3,1 Introduction,,
378,"Fregean Principle, although it is unlikely that he ever stated the principle in precisely this way.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
379,The meaning of an expression is a function of the meaning of its parts.,21,3,1 Introduction,,
380,"The notion of a function will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 4, but essentially it is an operation that derives a single result given a specified input.",21,3,1 Introduction,,
381,"Thus,",21,3,1 Introduction,,
382,1 Introduction the principle (3) minimally requires that the meaning of a larger expression be uniquely determined from the meanings of its component parts.,22,4,1 Introduction,,
383,"This cannot be all there is to compositionality, however, since, otherwise, we would expect that sentences containing the same words mean the same thing.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
384,"This is, of course, not true.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
385,The sentence Jo kicked Chester does not mean the same as Chester kicked Jo.,22,4,1 Introduction,,
386,"It must also be the case, therefore, that the syntactic structure of an expression is relevant to the derivation of its meaning.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
387,"Indeed, we may strengthen the principle of compositionality so that, in deriving the meaning of a composite expression, the meaning of its component expressions are combined in some way that refers to the way they are combined by the syntax.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
388,"This implies that wherever meanings are combined in a particular way to derive the meaning of a composite expression, all other composite expressions of the same sort have their meanings determined in the same way.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
389,"In other words, the construction of meanings is rule-governed, in the same way that the construction of the well-formed syntactic expressions of a language is rule-governed.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
390,"For example, whatever rule derives the meaning of the sentence Jo sang from the subject Jo and intransitive verb sang applies to all declarative sentences derived by combining a subject noun phrase with the appropriate form of an intransitive verb.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
391,"Furthermore, it is a general property of human languages that all the sub-expressions of a grammatically well-formed phrase have a role to play in the interpretation of a sentence, even if, on occasions, this role is predictably redundant",22,4,1 Introduction,,
392,"(as, for example, in double negative constructions in certain dialects of English like",22,4,1 Introduction,,
393,/ never did nothing where the second negative expression merely reinforces the idea of negation introduced by the first).,22,4,1 Introduction,,
394,"Semantic rules should, therefore, not be allowed to delete meanings during the derivation of the meaning of a composite expression.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
395,The effect of this restriction is to make the creation of the meanings of larger expressions monotonic with respect to their component parts where a derivation is said to be monotonic if all properties of previous parts of a derivation are maintained throughout.,22,4,1 Introduction,,
396,"In other words, once information is introduced into a monotonic derivation, it is not lost thereafter.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
397,The initial definition of compositionality in (3) may thus be strengthened to give the statement in (4).,22,4,1 Introduction,,
398,The principle of compositionality: The meaning of an expression is a monotonic function of the meaning of its parts and the way they are put together.,22,4,1 Introduction,,
399,The implications of this interpretation of the principle of compositionality is that meanings should be ascribed not only to lexemes and sentences but also to other syntactic constituents.,22,4,1 Introduction,,
400,"It is thus generally assumed that meanings should be assigned to all the well-formed constituents of a language, not just to its words (lexemes) and sentences.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
401,"Indeed, the concept of syntax as a bridge between phonology and semantics, current in many grammatical theories, would seem to require that all constituents be assigned a meaning by the semantics and, furthermore, that (surface) syntactic structure should directly determine how the meanings of sentences are derived.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
402,"It is common to assume that semantic constituency parallels syntactic constituency and hence that an adequate semantic theory must be able to ascribe appropriate meanings to noun phrases like the old cat, Jo's mother, Chester and verb phrases like sang, kicked the cat, ran slowly, etc, according to their syntactic structure.",22,4,1 Introduction,,
403,Semantics and semantic theory,23,5,1 Introduction,,
404,One way in which this may be achieved is to adopt the hypothesis that for each syntactic rule of the grammar (or syntactic structure admitted by the grammar) there is a corresponding semantic rule that derives the meaning of the resultant expression,23,5,1 Introduction,,
405,(or structure).,23,5,1 Introduction,,
406,"For example, assuming that there is a rule that defines a sentence in",23,5,1 Introduction,,
407,"English as consisting of a noun phrase plus a verb phrase, then the adoption of the rule-to-rule hypothesis in (5), together with the principle of compositionality in (4), requires that there be a corresponding semantic rule deriving the meaning of the sentence from the meanings of its immediate constituents, NP and VP.",23,5,1 Introduction,,
408,Rule-to-rule hypothesis: For each syntactic rule there is a corresponding semantic rule.,23,5,1 Introduction,,
409,"The principle of compositionality in (4) is assumed to be a constraint on semantic theories and, indeed, will be seen to be the primary motivator behind much of the discussion in later chapters.",23,5,1 Introduction,,
410,"The rule-to-rule hypothesis, on the other hand, is not a necessary requirement of a semantic theory, but a means of achieving compositionality.",23,5,1 Introduction,,
411,"We will have cause to question the validity of this hypothesis in the later chapters of this book, but it is used in the earlier chapters to maintain a transparent relation between syntactic structures and semantic representations.",23,5,1 Introduction,,
412,Meaning relations,23,5,1 Introduction,,
413,Another aspect of meaning that must be accounted for by any semantic theory is the systematic relations that hold between different expressions in a language.,23,5,1 Introduction,,
414,"According to the condition of adequacy in (1 .b), a theory must satisfactorily analyse the intuitions speakers of English have about the semantic relations between lexemes and between sentences.",23,5,1 Introduction,,
415,"This assumes that expressions in a language which may not be syntactically related may be related semantically and, indeed, such is the case.",23,5,1 Introduction,,
416,Consider the sentences in (6).,23,5,1 Introduction,,
417,"Assuming that the reference of the name Jo and the discourse context are held constant for all the sentences in (6), then the sentences in (6.b) to (6.i) are semantically related to that in (6.a), even though it is not always the case that there is a direct syntactic relation between them.",23,5,1 Introduction,,

435,Jo stroked an animal.,23,5,1 Introduction,,
436,"The relation between the sentences in (6.a) and those in (6.b) and (6.c) is one of entailment, as it is intuitively impossible for it to be true that Jo stroked a cat on some occasion without it also being true that a cat was stroked or that there existed a cat to be stroked on that occasion.",23,5,1 Introduction,,
437,"We may thus define a sentence S, as entailing a sentence S2 if the latter truly describes a situation whenever the former also does.",23,5,1 Introduction,,
438,The,23,5,1 Introduction,,
439,I Introduction negation of an entailment always derives a contradiction and a sentence Si may be said to contradict a sentence S2 if the former must be false when the latter is true (or vice versa).,24,6,1 Introduction,,
440,"For example, the assertion that Jo stroked a cat is contradicted by the non-existence of cats, making (6.e) a contradiction of (6.a).",24,6,1 Introduction,,
441,"The relation between (6.a) and the sentences in (6.f) and (6.g) is also primarily semantic, although most syntactic theories recognise a syntactic relation between the sentences as well.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
442,"Using a common term in a technical way, we may say these sentences are paraphrases of each other, since they all have the same core meaning.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
443,Another way of putting this is to say that they mutually entail each other.,24,6,1 Introduction,,
444,"Hence, we may say that a sentence Si is a paraphrase of a sentence S2 if Si entails S2 and S2 entails S,.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
445,"An adequate theory of semantics must, therefore, provide an account of entailment, contradiction and paraphrase that allows one to identify which sentences are entailed by, or contradict or paraphrase, another in a language.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
446,"Indeed, this concern, along with compositionality, is a major motivation for the theoretical programme developed in this book.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
447,Other sorts of implication between sentences are also recognised in general linguistic semantics.,24,6,1 Introduction,,
448,"Some of these derive from lexical meaning as in (6.h) and (6.i) which are related to (6.a) by virtue of the meanings of the lexemes STROKE and CAT, respectively.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
449,"It is part of the meaning of the lexeme STROKE thai an action of stroking also involves an action of touching, so that (6.a) implies (6.h).",24,6,1 Introduction,,
450,"Furthermore, it is part of the meaning of CAT that anything that is a cat is also an animal and thus (6.a) implies (6.i).",24,6,1 Introduction,,
451,"The meaning relations that hold between the lexemes of a language (or between lexemes and larger expressions) are called sense relations and include hyponymy, which holds if the sense of one lexeme includes that of another (e.g.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
452,"between CAT and ANIMAL); synonymy, where two lexemes have the same sense (e.g.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
453,"betv/eenMERCURYand QUICKSILVER); and oppositeness, where two lexemes have opposing senses (e.g. BIG and SMALL and DEAD and ALIVE).",24,6,1 Introduction,,
454,"Hence, an adequate theory of semantics must give some account of lexical meaning and, in particular, of the sense relations that hold between lexemes in a particular language.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
455,Other implicational meaning relations hold between sentences in addition to those that have been noted above.,24,6,1 Introduction,,
456,"One of these is so-called conversational implicature, which is derived not from the conventional meanings of words or sentences, but from principles of discourse and context.",24,6,1 Introduction,,
457,"For example, in the exchange in (7), the apparent irrelevance of Ethel's reply in (7.b) to Bertie's question in (7.a) leads the latter to infer (7.c).",24,6,1 Introduction,,
458,The reason behind inference has to do with Bertie's expectations about Ethel's co-operativeness in providing him with the information he needs.,24,6,1 Introduction,,
459,"The fact that she has not given a straight answer leads Bertie, not to assume that she is being deliberately unhelpful, but to look for some piece of information that is relevant to his question that is indirectly implied by Ethel's response.",24,6,1 Introduction,,

527,Homonyms can be divided into full homonyms (like,26,8,1 Introduction,,

536,"As will be seen in Chapter 2, the approach to homonymy taken here is very simplistic: the senses of homonymous lexemes are simply differentiated formally by the use of superscripts, where necessary.",26,8,1 Introduction,,
537,"Although an account of polysemy and a better approach to homonymy may be possible within the theory of formal semantics presented in later chapters, these matters are not central to the concerns of this book and an adequate discussion of the issues involved would only serve to increase the size of the book without serving any great purpose.",26,8,1 Introduction,,
538,The decision to exclude polysemy from consideration and to take a simplistic view of homonymy is taken on the grounds of expository convenience and readers are again referred to the further reading noted at the end of the chapter.,26,8,1 Introduction,,

541,Here the ambiguity results from the possibility of assigning two or more syntactic structures to a single grammatical string of words.,27,9,1 Introduction,,
542,"To ascertain the meaning of (lO.b), for example, it is necessary to know whether the adjective radical modifies the nominal phrase, lecturers and students, in which case both the lecturers and the students who called the strike are all radical, or whether it modifies just the noun lecturers, in which case the lecturers who called the strike are said to be radical but the political attitude of the students who did so is not specified.",27,9,1 Introduction,,

555,"(ll.a), it modifies, and thus has scope over, the noun lecturers, while in (ll.b) its scope is the nominal phrase lecturers and students.",27,9,1 Introduction,,
556,"Scope is an important concept in semantics and a primary source of ambiguity which involves not only adjectives, but also conjunctions, like and, or, etc and quantifiers, like every, all, and some in",27,9,1 Introduction,,
557,English.,27,9,1 Introduction,,
558,"Structural ambiguity of this sort thus has its source in the syntax of a language, but there are other scope ambiguities that do not directly depend on the syntactic structure of a sentence.",27,9,1 Introduction,,
559,"Such ambiguity usually involves negation (not), quantification (every, some) and other elements like tense, which do not vary their syntactic position according to the reading of the sentence.",27,9,1 Introduction,,
560,"For example, the two readings of the sentence in (lO.c) can be made clear by those in (12).",27,9,1 Introduction,,
561,"In (12.a), there is only one cause that every good politician loves, while in (12.b) each politician may love a different cause.",27,9,1 Introduction,,
562,"The sentence in (lO.c), however, is usually only assigned a single surface constituent structure, so that this ambiguity cannot be directly attributed to a syntactic source and is referred to as a semantic scope ambiguity.",27,9,1 Introduction,,

568,"It should also ensure that sentences that have two (or more) syntactic derivations, but only one semantic interpretation, are not assigned more than one meaning (see Chapter 3 for examples involving the conjunctions and and or).",27,9,1 Introduction,,

571,Denotation,28,10,1 Introduction,,
572,"The final criterion of adequacy that is considered here is stated in (2), above, and is the most important for our purposes, since it forms the basis of the semantic theory to be proposed in the rest of this book.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
573,This criterion requires a semantic theory to give an account of the relation between linguistic expressions and what they can be used to talk about.,28,10,1 Introduction,,
574,"Since language can be used to talk about what is outside the linguistic system, it is essential that a semantic theory should be able to associate linguistic expressions with extra-linguistic objects.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
575,"Language is not used solely to talk about itself, but rather it is most commonly used to convey information about the situations in which human beings find themselves.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
576,"Since a listener can in general understand the meaning of what is being said by a speaker, meanings must be publicly accessible in some sense.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
577,One way that this public accessibility must be realised is in the association of linguistic expressions with publicly identifiable entities and situations.,28,10,1 Introduction,,
578,"For example, the utterance of a sentence like The book is on the table conveys information about two entities, one of which is conventionally called a book in",28,10,1 Introduction,,
579,"English and one of which is conventionally called a table, and the relation between them.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
580,Someone who hears an utterance of this sentence associates it with the situation pictorially represented in (13).,28,10,1 Introduction,,
581,"Although (13) is itself a representation of an actual (or possible) situation, it is nonetheless a non-linguistic representation and a theory of semantics should be capable of relating the meaning of the sentence to the picture and, indeed, to concrete, non-representational situations where there is a (single) book on the table.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
582,"The association between the sentence The book is on the table and the situation represented in (13) depends in part on there being, in the situation described, an instance of a thing that is conventionally called a book and one that is conventionally called a table in English.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
583,"In other words, part of the meaning of the sentence depends on the sorts of extra-linguistic entities that can be referred to by the lexemes BOOK and TABLE.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
584,The aspect of the meaning of an expression that concerns its relation to such objects is called its denotation and an expression is said to denote particular sorts of extra-linguistic objects.,28,10,1 Introduction,,
585,"Although this relation has often been called the reference of an expression, this book follows the usage of Lyons (1977) and reserves this latter term for the act of picking out a particular entity denoted by the expression through the utterance of that expression on some occasion.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
586,"For example, in uttering the sentence The book is on the table, a speaker is said to be referring to two particular, contextually unique, entities.",28,10,1 Introduction,,
587,"The entities being referred to by the use of the definite noun phrases, the book and the table, are single elements in the class of entities denoted by the lexemes BOOK and TABLE.",28,10,1 Introduction,,

589,"No more will be said here about the act of reference, and the differences between denotation and reference, but for more details the reader is urged to consult the further reading at the end of this chapter.",28,10,1 Introduction,,

599,"Thus, the noun",29,11,1 Introduction,,
600,LOVE is taken to denote a set of entities just like BOOK.,29,11,1 Introduction,,
601,The difference between them is that the entities denoted by the former are abstract while those denoted by the latter are concrete.,29,11,1 Introduction,,
602,"Although the postulation of abstract entities of this sort may cause problems from a philosophical point of view, it does have the advantage of reflecting the fact that the same sorts of linguistic expressions (e.g. nouns) are used in many, if not all, languages to refer to both abstract and concrete things.",29,11,1 Introduction,,
603,"In a similar fashion, lexemes describing fictitious entities like hobbits, or entities that are no longer extant like dodos, are also assumed to have a denotation.",29,11,1 Introduction,,
604,"It is, however, useful to distinguish between the denotations of lexemes that may be used to refer to entities that exist in the real world (including abstract ones) and those that do not.",29,11,1 Introduction,,
605,We can do this by making a distinction between two aspects of denotation.,29,11,1 Introduction,,
606,"Nouns like BOOK may be used to refer to entities in the world, but the entities of which one can truthfully say That is a book all share a certain common property, their",29,11,1 Introduction,,
607,"'bookness', so to speak.",29,11,1 Introduction,,
608,"In the same way, the set of entities that are red all have the property of redness and the set of entities that run all have the property of running.",29,11,1 Introduction,,
609,"In other words, we distinguish between the property denoted by a common noun like",29,11,1 Introduction,,
610,"BOOK, adjective like RED or intransitive verb like RUN and the entities it can be used to refer to.",29,11,1 Introduction,,
611,The former part of the meaning of the lexeme is often referred to as its sense and is opposed to the idea of its reference.,29,11,1 Introduction,,
612,"However, just as the latter term is used here for a different notion, so too is that of sense which is used solely with respect to the sense relations that hold between the lexemes of a language (see Section",29,11,1 Introduction,,
613,1.2 and Chapter 7).,29,11,1 Introduction,,
614,The distinction between the different aspects of the meaning of,29,11,1 Introduction,,
615,BOOK noted above are treated as a distinction between the intension of an expression,29,11,1 Introduction,,
616,I Introduction and its extension.,30,12,1 Introduction,,
617,"The former corresponds to the property aspect of common nouns, whereas the latter corresponds to the entities that they may be used to refer to in the world.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
618,"Thus, the extension of the lexeme BOOK is the set of all books whilst its intension is the property of being a book.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
619,Both properties and sets of entities are external to the linguistic system and thus constitute aspects of denotation.,30,12,1 Introduction,,
620,"This distinction allows a differentiation between entities like books which have existence in the real world and those like unicorns that, presumably, do not.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
621,"In the latter case, the lexeme UNICORN has no extension in the real world, but it does have an intension, the property of being a unicorn.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
622,"Thus, we may speak about unicorns and other entities without them needing to exist in the real world.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
623,"This distinction is discussed in more detail in Chapters 9 and 10, where a specific theory of intensionality is put forward.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
624,"Until then, we will be concerned primarily with the notion of extension and thus be concentrating on the relation between linguistic expressions and existing entities.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
625,"It is not necessary to restrict the notion of denotation to lexemes, but it may be extended to all well-formed linguistic expressions.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
626,"For example, the verb phrase kicked a cat may be taken to denote the class of actions involving the kicking of a cat, which is distinct from the class of all actions involving kicking a dog which would be denoted by the expression kicked a dog, and so on.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
627,"The denotations of other expressions, like quantified noun phrases, are less easy to specify informally, but we will see in Chapter 6 how they can be defined.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
628,Those expressions that are not used to pick out external entities in any way may also have denotations.,30,12,1 Introduction,,
629,"Such expressions are typically described as functional or grammatical expressions, like determiners and conjunctions, as opposed to the content expressions, like nouns, verbs and adjectives.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
630,This distinction amongst the syntactic categories of a language is a traditional (and very useful) one and can be reflected in semantics by assigning rather different sorts of denotation to the two sorts of expression.,30,12,1 Introduction,,
631,Grammatical expressions are taken to denote logical relations between groups of entities that are denoted by content expressions.,30,12,1 Introduction,,
632,"This subject is dealt with in proper detail in later chapters of the book, where the differences between the denotations of content and functional elements will become clear.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
633,A theory of denotation is thus not a trivial one and any semantic theory that provides an account of this important relation has already achieved a great deal.,30,12,1 Introduction,,
634,"Throughout this book the terms denotation, denotes, intension and extension are used a great deal.",30,12,1 Introduction,,
635,"Although denotation most properly refers to the relation between an expression and some entity, event, property or relation, it will also be used below to refer to what an expression denotes (what Lyons (1977) calls the denotatum of an expression).",30,12,1 Introduction,,
636,The term is used in this way in discussions of general importance that include both extensional and intensional denotation.,30,12,1 Introduction,,
637,"Where reference is being made to what a specific expression denotes, the terms extension or intension are used, depending on which aspect of denotation is relevant.",30,12,1 Introduction,,

643,"For the rest of this book, we will be exploring a theory that attempts to provide an account of such phenomena and, in so doing, to define what semantic meaning is.",31,13,1 Introduction,,
644,There are a number of competing theories of meaning and the one that is adopted in this book starts from the premiss that one of the most important aspects of language is to talk about entities in the world.,31,13,1 Introduction,,
645,The central core of meaning in this theory is thus determined by the relation between linguistic expressions and the entities that they can be used to refer to.,31,13,1 Introduction,,
646,"In other words, denotation, and specifically extensional denotation, forms the basis of the theory of meaning developed here.",31,13,1 Introduction,,
647,"Although this theory has many critics and gives rise to a number of difficult problems, it nevertheless continues to have a large amount of support and has proved extremely fruitful in the study of linguistic semantics.",31,13,1 Introduction,,
648,"In this section, a general overview is presented of the major aspects of the theory that are presented in more detail in the following chapters.",31,13,1 Introduction,,
649,The main question that arises at this point is where the analysis should start.,31,13,1 Introduction,,
650,Many semantic theories have taken the meaning of words (lexemes) as basic and derived sentential (and phrasal) meanings from it.,31,13,1 Introduction,,
651,"Whatever the successes or failures of such theories, for a theory whose basis resides in the informational content of language, what languages may be used to talk about, it is more appropriate to begin with sentence meaning and derive the meanings of its constituent parts from this.",31,13,1 Introduction,,
652,Declarative sentences are typically used to make statements which convey information directly about some state of affairs.,31,13,1 Introduction,,
653,"Expressions smaller than a sentence, however, require more information from context for their interpretation than sentences do.",31,13,1 Introduction,,
654,"For example, in a situation in which there are two people, one of whom is searching for a particular book, the second person knows that the book that the first is looking for is on the table and may utter any of the four expressions in (14) to convey this information to his or her partner.",31,13,1 Introduction,,

680,"d. may be known, believed or doubted.",32,14,1 Introduction,,
681,"We will sidestep the controversy surrounding definitions like those in (16) and adopt all four statements as descriptions of the properties that propositions have and make the assumption that declarative sentences (which we will henceforth assume to be uttered only as statements, thus ignoring other uses of such sentence forms) express propositions on particular occasions of utterance.",32,14,1 Introduction,,
682,"According to (16.c), the proposition expressed by a sentence may be true or false and this truth or falsity may vary with respect to different occasions on which the sentence is uttered.",32,14,1 Introduction,,
683,"For example, the proposition expressed by the sentence The book is on the table uttered with respect to the situation depicted in (13) is true, but it is false, if uttered with respect to the situation pictorially illustrated in (15).",32,14,1 Introduction,,

685,"In terms of denotation, we may, therefore, think of sentences as extensionally denoting truth values on particular occasions of utterance (and, in Chapter 10, it will be suggested that sentences intensionally denote propositions).",32,14,1 Introduction,,
686,This rather abstract idea of a sentence extensionally denoting truth or falsity forms the starting point of the semantic theory to be pursued through the rest of this book and it is to a consideration of what it means for something to be true that we now turn.,32,14,1 Introduction,,

692,Since declarative sentences are used to make statements in English,33,15,1 Introduction,,
693,"(and other languages) and since, according to (16.a) above, declarative sentences are taken to express propositions when uttered as statements, we can revise (17) to apply to the particular case of human languages as in (18).",33,15,1 Introduction,,

696,"As we have seen, the proposition expressed by an utterance of The book is on the table is true with respect to the situation depicted in (13), but not to that depicted in (15), because in the latter case there is no correspondence between the state-of-affairs described by the sentence and that portrayed in the picture.",33,15,1 Introduction,,

698,"Just knowing whether a statement is true or false does not, of course, itself tell us what the statement means.",33,15,1 Introduction,,
699,Speakers of a language know the meaning of a sentence in their language even if they do not know the truth or falsity of the proposition expressed by that sentence.,33,15,1 Introduction,,
700,"For example, Ronnie has just dropped a cup of tea on the floor is a perfectly comprehensible sentence in English whose meaning is clear, irrespective of whether readers know whether it describes a true state-of-affairs.",33,15,1 Introduction,,
701,"Although readers may not know whether the proposition expressed by the sentence is true or false, they do know the conditions that must obtain for it to be true, i.e. they know what the world must be like for the statement to correspond to some actual state-of-affairs.",33,15,1 Introduction,,
702,"This idea forms the basis of truth-conditional semantics, whose central hypothesis is that the core meaning of a sentence is its truth-conditions.",33,15,1 Introduction,,
703,To know the core meaning of a sentence uttered as a statement is to understand the conditions under which it could be true.,33,15,1 Introduction,,
704,The theory thus equates core meaning with knowledge of how the truth of a declarative sentence can be ascertained without requiring the truth or falsity of a sentence to be known or know able in any particular situation.,33,15,1 Introduction,,

736,"Much of what is done in later chapters concerns the development of a metalanguage, still based on English but with a rigorous interpretation, that may be used to specify the truth-conditions of a range of English sentence types (and by hypothesis equivalent types in other human languages).",34,16,1 Introduction,,
737,This metalanguage is used to connect the proposition(s) expressed by a sentence to states-of-affairs by detailing the relationship between the syntactic structure of the sentence and the denotations of the lexemes and other expressions that make this up.,34,16,1 Introduction,,
738,"In this way, the core meaning of the constituent expressions of a sentence is defined as the contribution they (or more strictly their denotations) make to the truth-conditions associated with that sentence.",34,16,1 Introduction,,

741,The notion of truth introduced in the previous subsection is based on the work of the logician Alfred Tarski who intended that the correspondence theory of truth would be used to provide a semantics for formal or logical languages quite unlike the languages that are spoken by human beings.,35,17,1 Introduction,,
742,"Hence, the application of the truth-conditional method has often been referred to as formal semantics.",35,17,1 Introduction,,
743,Its formal nature also resides in the fact that it utilises very precise notations and concepts to define as accurately and as rigorously as possible how expressions in the object language are to be interpreted.,35,17,1 Introduction,,
744,All aspects of the metalanguage in which the semantics is defined are precisely determined.,35,17,1 Introduction,,
745,"There is no room for ambiguity, vagueness or inaccuracy and hence much of the specification of the metalanguage is mathematical or logical in form.",35,17,1 Introduction,,
746,"One of the advantages of constructing a formal metalanguage with a precise interpretation is that it is thereby possible to check the consequences of one's theory and prove, or disprove, that such-and-such a consequence results from the way the semantics is set up.",35,17,1 Introduction,,
747,"Within logic, the construction of formal semantic systems is bound up with the idea of proving that certain forms of argument within some formal language are valid whilst others are not.",35,17,1 Introduction,,
748,"For example, within propositional logic the pattern of inference in (24) is valid, whilst that in (25) is not and these patterns are reflected in the English sentences that accompany the logical expressions below.",35,17,1 Introduction,,
749,"There is nothing in the syntax of the logical statements in (24) that determines that the inference in (24.c) is valid and it is the purpose of the semantic theory to show that whatever p and q stand for, the truth of the expression p —> q and of p always guarantees the truth of q while the truth ofp—>q and q does not always guarantee the truth of p.",35,17,1 Introduction,,

763,"It is interesting to note here that while formalisation within syntactic theory has been accepted as a useful, if not a necessary, part of syntactic analysis, its adoption within semantics remains a subject of considerable debate.",35,17,1 Introduction,,
764,"However, the adoption of a formal interpretation procedure for a particular object language makes it possible to ascertain accurately whether or not one's theory is correct as an account of the meaning of particular object languages, just as a formalisation of syntax into formal rules or principles enables the syntactician to test whether they generate ungrammatical expressions or fail to generate grammatical ones.",35,17,1 Introduction,,
765,It is furthermore possible with such systems to prove that a semantics is consistent (i.e. contains no internal contradictions) and complete (i.e. it derives the set of all valid arguments of the language as theorems).,35,17,1 Introduction,,
766,"Although these last two aspects of formal semantics will not be discussed in this book, the fact that these things can be more easily be proved with respect to semantic theories that are formalised than to those that are not will be taken as positive, if implicit, arguments in favour of formalisation as a tool of the semantic analysis of human languages.",35,17,1 Introduction,,

768,"In the discussion above, much has been made of the fact that the propositions expressed by declarative sentences may differ in truth value with respect to different situations.",36,18,1 Introduction,,
769,"In other words, their truth is not absolute but depends on when the sentence expressing the proposition is uttered, on the location and other aspects of the context of utterance (including the modality of the sentence itself)- This idea may be formalised by constructing mathematical models of a state-of-affairs and defining truth with respect to particular models.",36,18,1 Introduction,,

784,"As will be seen in more detail from Chapter 3 onwards, model-theoretic interpretation has two parts.",36,18,1 Introduction,,
785,"In the first place, there is a model that represents precisely what events, properties and relations make up the situation being modelled.",36,18,1 Introduction,,
786,The model provides a description of the denotations of all the basic expressions,36,18,1 Introduction,,
787,(content lexemes) in the object language.,36,18,1 Introduction,,
788,This reflects the fact that human beings make statements in order to convey information about some state-of-affairs.,36,18,1 Introduction,,
789,"Although one can know the meaning of a sentence without knowing what specific situation is being talked about (by knowing its truth-conditions), the sentence conveys no information unless it is associated with particular individuals and the relations that hold between them.",36,18,1 Introduction,,
790,The second part of the theory provides the rules for interpreting expressions in the object language with respect to any arbitrary model.,36,18,1 Introduction,,
791,It does this by providing a recursive definition that specifies how the denotations of composite expressions are constructed from those of their component parts.,36,18,1 Introduction,,
792,"In other words, the model theory provides a specification of the truth-conditions of the sentences in the object language.",36,18,1 Introduction,,
793,"The truth-conditions as specified by the model theory hold independently of particular models, but the interpretation of particular sentences may be carried out only with respect to some model or other.",36,18,1 Introduction,,
794,One may also think of model theory as constraining the sorts of model that are admissible for the interpretation of some language.,36,18,1 Introduction,,
795,Not all possible models are interpretable according to a particular model theory and there is thus a two-way relation between the theory and the model.,36,18,1 Introduction,,
796,"On the one hand, models are constructed to represent a given set of phenomena and, on the other, the way that phenomena can be represented is constrained by the theory of interpretation.",36,18,1 Introduction,,
797,"From the linguistic perspective, the theory of meaning thus influences the way states-of-affairs can be represented and talked about.",36,18,1 Introduction,,
798,It has been said that the models used to represent situations with respect to which sentences are to be interpreted are mathematical.,36,18,1 Introduction,,
799,"In fact, the models in this book are based on set theory.",36,18,1 Introduction,,
800,The denotations of lexemes are thus modelled as sets containing,36,18,1 Introduction,,
801,Beyond truth-conditions various sorts of entity or as mathematical functions over these.,37,19,1 Introduction,,
802,"The model theory uses fundamental notions from set theory, like set membership, union and intersection, etc., to specify how the denotations of more composite expressions can be constructed from these.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
803,"Ultimately the notion of truth is characterised according to the axioms of set theory, thus providing the rigorous and formal metalanguage for interpretation that was discussed above.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
804,"No previous knowledge of set theory is, however, assumed in the discussion of later chapters and all relevant concepts are introduced as and when they are needed.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
805,13 Beyond truth-conditions,37,19,1 Introduction,,
806,"In the discussion of the last section, it was suggested that the central meaning of a sentence is the set of conditions that guarantee its truth with respect to any occasion of utterance.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
807,"This does not mean that truth-conditions exhaust the whole of sentence meaning, let alone all aspects of linguistic meaning.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
808,A complete explication of the latter requires considerably more than just truth-conditions.,37,19,1 Introduction,,
809,"However, the hypothesis that truth-conditional meaning is central predicts that other aspects of meaning interact with this to derive the meaning of an utterance.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
810,"In other words, we may think of linguistic meaning being determined by the interaction of a number of theories dealing with particular domains of meaning.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
811,This section takes a brief look at some of the other theories of meaning that are needed to interact with truth-conditional interpretation to provide a more adequate account of meaning than is possible using truth-conditions on their own.,37,19,1 Introduction,,
812,"Knowledge, behaviour and use",37,19,1 Introduction,,
813,"In the discussion of truth-conditions, we have referred only to the interpretation of declarative sentences uttered as statements.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
814,"But, of course, declarative sentences may be used to ask questions and issue commands, as well as make statements, and there are other sentence types that are typically used in the latter ways.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
815,"For example, the sentence in (27 .a) is a declarative that is typically used to make a statement.",37,19,1 Introduction,,
816,"The addition of a question mark in the orthography as in (27.b), orrisingintonation at the end of the sentence in spoken English, turns the statement into a question that has the same meaning as the interrogative in (27.c).",37,19,1 Introduction,,

827,Jo engages in the activity of kicking a (contextually unique) cat and that this is not the first time he or she has done so.,37,19,1 Introduction,,
828,"These are, of course, the truth-conditions associated with the declarative sentence in (27.a), and the truth-conditions of a declarative sentence may be equated with its propositional content, which is distinct from the",37,19,1 Introduction,,
829,1 Introduction proposition expressed by a sentence and from the truth or falsity of that proposition on some occasion of utterance.,38,20,1 Introduction,,
830,"It is propositional content that may be considered to be the common core of meaning that syntactically related sentences share, whatever their surface form.",38,20,1 Introduction,,
831,"Thus, each of the sentences in (27) share the same propositional content but in their different uses bear a different relation to that content.",38,20,1 Introduction,,
832,(27 .a) states that the situation described by the propositional content actually occurred.,38,20,1 Introduction,,
833,"On the other hand, (27.b) and (27.c) ask whether the situation described by the propositional content has occurred or not, i.e. whether the proposition expressed by (27.a) is true or false with respect to some context of utterance, and (27.d) is typically uttered to bring about a situation in which the proposition expressed by (27.a) is true.",38,20,1 Introduction,,
834,The sentences in (27) thus possess the same propositional content but differ in their illocutionary force.,38,20,1 Introduction,,
835,"The way content relates to use forms the study of speech act theory which concentrates, not so much on the abstract meaning of a sentence, but on what people are doing when they utter it.",38,20,1 Introduction,,
836,"It, therefore, takes into account extralinguistic information like speaker intentions (what perlocutionary effect a speaker intends to have by the utterance of an expression), socio-cultural knowledge",38,20,1 Introduction,,
837,(whether the utterance of some expression is felicitous or not) and so on.,38,20,1 Introduction,,
838,"Such things do not form part of truth-conditional meaning, but can form the basis of the relation between abstract sentence meaning and the meaning that an utterance of that sentence has in particular situations.",38,20,1 Introduction,,
839,Another aspect of meaning that does not come within the realm of truth-conditional semantics has its basis in discourse behaviour.,38,20,1 Introduction,,
840,This concerns the sorts of inferences that are drawn by participants in a discourse.,38,20,1 Introduction,,
841,"In Section 1.2, we looked at the sorts of meaning relations between sentences that are within the possible domain of truth-conditional semantics.",38,20,1 Introduction,,
842,"These relations allow inferences to be drawn from utterances because the truth of a paraphrase or an entailment, or the falsity of a contradiction, are guaranteed by the truth of the proposition expressed by the original sentence.",38,20,1 Introduction,,
843,"The assumption that participants in a discourse are being co-operative and, in general, telling the truth is one of the conversational maxims put forward by the philosopher Paul Grice in the nineteen-sixties.",38,20,1 Introduction,,
844,This assumption allows inferences to be made from entailments even if the participants have no way of checking the truth or falsity of any assertion.,38,20,1 Introduction,,
845,"As mentioned in Section 1.1.2, inferences can be drawn from discourse that do not follow directly from the truth-conditions of a sentence.",38,20,1 Introduction,,

859,"Grice suggested a number of conversational maxims, which are given in (29).",39,21,1 Introduction,,
860,The interaction of these maxims with the truth-conditional import of the full sentences that underlie the expressions uttered in any discourse gives rise to conversational implicatures that allow a speaker to convey information over and above what is actually said (i.e. in terms of truth-conditions) in any exchange.,39,21,1 Introduction,,
861,Implicatures of the sort illustrated by (7) are highly context-specific and often rely on assumptions being made by the hearer that are cmpletely dependent on the context.,39,21,1 Introduction,,
862,"For example, a similar exchange to that in (7.a) and (7.b) where the context contains information to the effect that there is a good lecturer who has a good line in sweaters will lead Bertie to infer the opposite of (7.c), i.e. that Fiona is a good lecturer.",39,21,1 Introduction,,

906,"The resolution of such ellipsis is dependent on the context, since an utterance of the expression in (31 .b) could be interpreted as asserting that any number of entities are in here, depending on the circumstances.",40,22,1 Introduction,,
907,"Just restoring ellipses is not sufficient to enable the interpretation of (31) to take place, however.",40,22,1 Introduction,,
908,The context must also provide referents for all the deictic expressions.,40,22,1 Introduction,,
909,"The term deixis is derived from the Classical Greek verb deiknumi meaning 'to point out' or 'show' (the Latin translation being demonstrativus, hence the term demonstrative pronoun).",40,22,1 Introduction,,
910,"The purpose of deictic elements is to link aspects of the meaning of the sentence containing them to the context in which it is uttered, either spatially, temporally or in terms of the participants in the discourse.",40,22,1 Introduction,,
911,"Deixis may be realised as words, particles or morphological processes.",40,22,1 Introduction,,
912,"For example, in (31) the indexical pronoun / in (31.b) (restored from context) refers to Jo, but in (31.e) it refers to Fiona, i.e. the respective speakers of the expressions.",40,22,1 Introduction,,
913,"Similarly, the pronoun",40,22,1 Introduction,,
914,"A note on method you in (31 .e) refers to the hearer in the discourse who happens to be Jo in this instance, but could be someone else in another context.",41,23,1 Introduction,,
915,"Furthermore, context is required to indicate the location indicated by the term here in (31 .b) (i.e. near the speaker) and the time when Fiona bought the milk in (31.e) (the day before the day on which the utterance of the sentence is made).",41,23,1 Introduction,,
916,Grammatical tense is also deictic and serves to refer to times relative to the context of utterance at which the situations described by any declarative sentences are deemed to take place.,41,23,1 Introduction,,
917,"Thus, in (31 .b), (31 .c) and (31 .d), the relevant time is the present (the time of utterance) whilst in both sentences in",41,23,1 Introduction,,
918,(31.e) (ignoring the interjection) the relevant time is prior to the time of utterance.,41,23,1 Introduction,,
919,Other aspects of the dialogue in (31) also require the assistance of the context to enable interpretation to take place.,41,23,1 Introduction,,
920,"For example, the pronoun some in (31 .e) is to be interpreted as some milk, picking up on the mention of milk in the previous utterance.",41,23,1 Introduction,,
921,"The anaphoric pronoun it in the final sentence refers to the milk that Fiona bought yesterday, information that is not explicitly stated in the utterance.",41,23,1 Introduction,,
922,"In addition to anaphoric resolution of this sort, the context resolves the ambiguity of the homonym",41,23,1 Introduction,,
923,"PUNCH which is interpreted as the drink and not the action because of the fact that the subject of this latter part of the conversation is milk, something that is drunk.",41,23,1 Introduction,,
924,This short example indicates the extent to which interpretation relies on the context of utterance.,41,23,1 Introduction,,
925,"The relation between context and interpretation is, however, extremely complex.",41,23,1 Introduction,,
926,"Although ti^ere are certain aspects that have been incorporated into truth-conditional semantics (as, for example, tense, cf. Chapter 8, and certain sorts of anaphora), exactly how the context resolves ambiguities, anaphoric dependencies and ellipsis and the way participants in a discourse tie up referential expressions to particular individuals remains obscure.",41,23,1 Introduction,,
927,"In what follows, it is recognised that the context is almost always required to fix the reference of expressions (and disambiguate ambiguous utterances), but we will proceed on the assumption that a theory of truth-conditional interpretation accounts for the meaning of sentences considered as abstract units of the language system.",41,23,1 Introduction,,
928,The definition of the meaning of a sentence is given in the discussion above in terms of truth-conditions and truth-conditions are associated with propositional content.,41,23,1 Introduction,,
929,"Since the latter is independent of context, then truth-conditional meaning may also be treated independently of context, even though, as we have seen, the actual interpretation of a specific utterance requires information provided by the context.",41,23,1 Introduction,,

933,"A sketch has been given of those aspects of meaning that form the central domain of inquiry, of some of those that do not, and of the main tenets of the theory to be adopted below.",41,23,1 Introduction,,
934,"Before starting on the long road to Chapter 10, however, something must be said about the methodology adopted in the following chapters.",41,23,1 Introduction,,
935,"In order to avoid problems with context, like those discussed in the last section, all interpretation is carried out, not directly on the sentences of a language or even",41,23,1 Introduction,,
936,"1 Introduction on their structural descriptions, but on a logical language into which the object language is translated.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
937,The logical translation of a declarative sentence is intended to represent the proposition expressed by the utterance of that sentence on some particular occasion.,42,24,1 Introduction,,
938,"As it fully represents all the information supplied by the context of utterance, it represents only one reading of an ambiguous sentence at a time, the one intended on a particular occasion.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
939,"For this reason, the translation language must be a disambiguated language, i.e. permit no ambiguity.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
940,"Furthermore, translation resolves all anaphoric, deictic and referential uncertainties of the utterance of the sentence, thus making sure that each expression has a determinate denotation.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
941,"Essentially, the translation of a sentence can be thought of as the representation of the proposition derived from the sentence plus its context of utterance.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
942,"It acts, therefore, as an intermediate step between the syntactic analysis of an expression and its truth-conditional semantic interpretation.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
943,"Whether this level of representation is necessary, or not, is a controversial issue.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
944,"Richard Montague assumed that it was merely convenient rather than necessary, but later linguistic research has indicated that, at least as far as anaphoric and deictic reference is concerned, a representation intermediate between syntax and interpretation is required.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
945,It is assumed henceforth that translation is an intrinsic part of any semantic analysis.,42,24,1 Introduction,,
946,"Interpretation is carried out on the logical translation of a sentence, and so provides an indirect interpretation of the latter.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
947,"It is usual within formal semantics to provide not only an explicit semantic theory for an object language, but also an explicit syntax.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
948,Only by doing this can it be guaranteed that the principle of compositionality is being maintained.,42,24,1 Introduction,,
949,"In studying the formal semantics of human languages, it would be a difficult task to specify a complete (and formally rigorous) definition of the syntax of a particular language before tackling the semantics.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
950,"Hence, it is customary to define grammar fragments that determine only a subset of the set of grammatical sentences of the object language with the semantic interpretation specified for these sentences (via their translation into a logical language).",42,24,1 Introduction,,
951,"Once this interpretation has been successfully defined, the coverage of the fragment is extended to take in more constructions.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
952,"In this way, it is hoped that ultimately a complete formal grammar of a language, containing both an explicit syntax and semantics, can be obtained (this hope is, however, still a very long way from realisation).",42,24,1 Introduction,,
953,"This method will be pursued in Chapters 2 to 6 of this book, beginning with a formal analysis of a fragment of English including proper names and simple intransitive, transitive and ditransitive sentences.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
954,"This is expanded into an explicit account of co-ordination, passives and noun phrases.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
955,"In the final chapters, the syntactic aspect of the analysis is not so explicit, because of the debates about the proper syntactic treatment of such things as tense, modality and finite and non-finite complementation.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
956,"Some discussion will, however, be given of some of the difficulties presented by these constructions for the syntax.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
957,"It is commonplace nowadays to assume that interpretation depends on the surface constituent structure of a sentence, although different theories adopt a more or less abstract interpretation of this level of syntactic representation.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
958,"It is not the intention of this book to support or criticise any particular theory of syntax, however.",42,24,1 Introduction,,
959,The semantic method outlined below can be adapted to many different syntactic theories and each one has its own merits and leads to its own problems from the semantic point of view.,42,24,1 Introduction,,
960,"To maintain relative neutrality between theories, the syntactic",42,24,1 Introduction,,
961,Further reading framework that is adopted in this book is that of simple context-free phrase structure grammar.,43,25,1 Introduction,,
962,"This type of grammar has advantages and disadvantages, but has the merit of being well known and easily describable.",43,25,1 Introduction,,
963,"Each grammar fragment in the following pages, therefore, takes the form of a set of context-free phrase structure rules together with an appropriate lexicon.",43,25,1 Introduction,,
964,"The translation of each sentence generated by the grammar into a disambiguated logical language is carried out in parallel with its derivation according to the specified phrase structure rules, in accordance with the rule-to-rule hypothesis in (5) above.",43,25,1 Introduction,,
965,"Finally, before we move on to the real work of the book, it should be noted that until time is introduced into the model in Chapter 8, every example sentence is given in its simple past tense form.",43,25,1 Introduction,,
966,It is usual within most introductions to logic in linguistics to put sentences into the present tense.,43,25,1 Introduction,,
967,"Unfortunately, the present tense in",43,25,1 Introduction,,
968,"English is rarely used to report events neutrally, but has aspectual and futurate interpretations that can sometimes obscure the intended sense of an example.",43,25,1 Introduction,,
969,"No such problems are associated with the simple past, however, and this is used throughout",43,25,1 Introduction,,

975,These give references to other introductory texts that cover all or some of the topics discussed in each chapter and also to one or two more advanced books or articles on specific topics that have been mentioned in the text.,43,25,1 Introduction,,
976,"Not all the topics that are discussed in the text are given further reading and the references that are given are very selective, only those works that the current author thinks are accessible and/or of reasonable importance being given.",43,25,1 Introduction,,
977,"Although these references, and the accompanying bibliography, are in no way comprehensive, it is hoped that readers will use them to get more details of specific issues and to treat them as suitable starting points for more protracted research.",43,25,1 Introduction,,

1019,Translating English into a logical language,45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1020,"In this chapter and the next, we will lay the foundations on which a good deal of logical semantics is built.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1021,"In accordance with the discussion in Chapter 1, we first define a logical language into which sentences of English are translated in order to circumvent the problems of ambiguity and underdeterminacy found in the object language.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1022,"Having defined the translation language, and specified the procedure for translating simple English sentences into it, our attention will turn to the interpretation of these logical expressions in terms of their truth-conditions, thus providing an indirect interpretation of the corresponding English sentences.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1023,The syntax of LP,45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1024,"Like all languages, natural or artificial, logical languages have a syntax, i.e. a set of rules for constructing composite expressions from simpler ones.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1025,"The logical language described in this chapter, called LP, contains expressions that fall into one of four logical categories: individuals, predicates, formulae and operators (or connectives).",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1026,"Expressions in each of the first three categories can be further subdivided into two sorts: constants, which have a fixed interpretation, and variables, which do not.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1027,"These two sorts of expression correspond, roughly, to content words (e.g. table, run,",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1028,"Ethel) and pronominal expressions (e.g. she, they) in natural languages, respectively.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1029,"This chapter deals only with constants, but variables will become increasingly important in later chapters.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1030,Sentences in natural languages translate into formulae in LP which have the logical category t (as sentences have the syntactic category S).,45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1031,Such expressions are constructed by combining individual and predicate expressions in much the same way that sentences are composed of combinations of noun phrases and verbs.,45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1032,"Just as certain noun phrases in a sentence can be described as the complements of the main verb, so individual expressions, of logical category e, perform the role of arguments of the predicates in a formula.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1033,Predicates in LP may take zero or more individuals as arguments and the number of arguments that a predicate takes is referred to as the valency of the predicate.,45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1034,"Predicate constants and variables are subcategorised according to their valency, just as verbs are subcategorised according to whether they are intransitive, transitive or ditransitive, etc. All predicates are classed as members of the logical category Pred and their subcategorisation according to the number of individual arguments they take is shown by the use of a subscripted number to the right of the category symbol.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1035,"Thus, for example, the category Predi contains all those predicates that take just one individual as an argument, the category",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1036,"Pred2 contains all those predicates that take two individual arguments, and so on.",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1037,"Unlike verbs in natural languages, however, there is no upper limit on the number of arguments a predicate in LP can take; thus the language may contain an infinite number of subcategories of predicates, Pred«, where n is any number between zero",45,27,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1038,2 Predicates and arguments and infinity.,46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1039,"For the purposes of translating from English into LP, however, we can safely ignore all predicates that have a valency higher than 3.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1040,"Thus, only four of the possible subcategories of Pred are used below: Pred0, Predi, Pred2 and Pred3.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1041,The basic syntactic rule for constructing formulae in L P is one that combines a predicate expression with the number of individual arguments it requires.,46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1042,"Thus, an expression in Pred! combines with one individual expression to make a formula, an expression in Pred2 combines with two individual expressions to make a formula and, in general, an expression in Pred,, combines with n individual expressions to make a formula, where n is some positive whole number.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1043,The predicate is written to the left of the arguments which are enclosed within round brackets and separated from each other by commas.,46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1044,"The appropriate rule appears in (1) where the superscripted number appearing with the individual category symbol, e, does not represent a subcategory of individual, but simply the number of the individual in the argument structure of the predicate.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1045,This ensures that predicates appear with the right number of arguments for their valency.,46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1046,"The symbol < in (1) is read as is less than, or equal to, so that in the rule n may be zero or any number greater than zero.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1047,"Pred0 is, therefore, a valid subcategory of Lp, but one that takes no arguments to make a formula.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1048,"Hence, Predo is equivalent to a formula, i.e. Pred0 = t.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1052,"Given the syntactic rule in (1) and some (abstract) expressions in LP (a, b, c, d being individual constants, P a one-place predicate, Q a two-place predicate and R a threeplace predicate), then all the expressions in (2) are well-formed formulae (often abbreviated as wff) in Lp, but those in (3) are not.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1077,"P(a,a)",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1078,"Having defined the (very simple) syntax of Lp, we are in a position to translate sentences of English into it.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1079,"To show how translation works, we shall provide a grammar for a small fragment of English and then develop a translation procedure that associates every sentence generated by the grammar with at least one logical expression.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1080,"As discussed at the end of Chapter 1, grammars for parts of a language are called grammar fragments and are often used in formal semantics to develop specific and precise theories about the meanings of the expressions they analyse.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1081,The grammar developed in this chapter and in Chapter 3 covers only a very small part of English and a syntactically very unexciting part at that.,46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1082,"Although we begin by analysing a rather small and uninteresting set of sentences, by the time we get to the end of the book, we will have covered a quite considerable number of English constructions and have armed ourselves with the machinery to tackle many more.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1083,"From the apparent triviality of the initial examples, a powerful semantic theory of a range of constructions in English will be developed.",46,28,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1084,Translating English into a logical language,47,29,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1085,The type of syntactic grammar adopted in this book is a simple context-free phrase structure grammar.,47,29,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1086,"There are many other forms of grammar, of course, that may well be syntactically more adequate than this, but context-free phrase structure grammars have the advantage of being easy to understand and simple to use.",47,29,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1087,"For example, it is always possible using a context-free phrase structure grammar to decide in a finite number of steps whether some string of words is generated by the grammar and it is therefore quite easy to check whether it generates ill-formed sentences of the object language.",47,29,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1088,"On the other hand, the well-known disadvantages of context-free phrase structure grammars are not particularly relevant for our purposes, since we are interested in semantics rather than syntax and the points made should be relevant to almost any syntactic theory.",47,29,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1089,The adoption of phrase structure grammar in this book is for expository purposes only and the syntactic analyses presented are not intended to be definitive.,47,29,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1090,Readers are invited to try to apply the semantic methods used in later chapters to the analyses of the same constructions determined by their favourite syntactic theory.,47,29,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1119,"These numbers are strictly unnecessary from the syntactic point of view, but essential for translation and interpretation purposes.",48,30,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1120,"They may be thought of as marking the grammatical function of the noun phrase within the sentence: so that NP, functions as the syntactic subject, NP2 as the syntactic direct object and NP3 as the syntactic indirect object.",48,30,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1216,This situation will be rectified in Chapter 6 when the interpretation of noun phrases is tackled in more detail.,50,32,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1217,"Verbs, which combine with noun phrases to form sentences, are naturally associated with the general semantic category of predicate.",50,32,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1220,"Transitive verbs, on the other hand, which subcategorise for a direct object and appear with a subject, thus translate into two-place predicates.",50,32,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1366,"We are now in a position to translate any sentence generated by the grammar, d , into Lp.",54,36,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1367,The translation procedure is entirely mechanical and is based on the syntactic derivation of the object language sentence.,54,36,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1368,The procedure provides each line in the derivation of an English sentence with a translation of that line as determined by the translation counterpart of the syntactic rule used to derive that line.,54,36,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1369,"For example, if there is a line in a derivation NP Wh with translation Vj'(NP') then the NP can be expanded as Npr using Rule 6 d .",54,36,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1370,This rule is associated with the translation rule in (16.f) which equates the translation of the noun phrase with that of the proper noun it contains.,54,36,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1371,The next line in the derivation is therefore Npr Vs with translation Vj'(Npr').,54,36,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1372,"Hence, just as one line in a syntactic derivation is derived from the previous one by substituting the string on the right of a syntactic rule for an instance of the symbol on its left, so the translation of the sentence is derived by substituting the translation of the expanded symbol with the translation of the syntactic rule that was used.",54,36,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1449,Interpreting Lp,56,38,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1450,We have now devised a procedure for translating (a restricted set of) sentences in,56,38,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1451,"English into a formal language, LP.",56,38,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1452,"As we have seen, formulae in Lp are unambiguous and have all contextual uncertainties resolved in order to provide a representation of the semantic content of the sentences in the object language which they translate.",56,38,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1453,"Translation into a logical language in this way is a useful method of representing the intended meaning of an English sentence on some occasion of utterance, but does not in itself constitute a theory of semantics.",56,38,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1454,What needs to be done to complete the,56,38,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1455,"Interpreting LP project is to interpret the formulae of Lp in terms of their truth-conditions, as discussed in Chapter 1.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1456,"In this way, the English sentences generated by d are provided with an indirect interpretation.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1457,There are two parts to the interpretation procedure.,57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1458,"In the first place, interpretation takes place, not in a vacuum, but with respect to a representation of some state-of-affairs.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1459,Such a representation is called a model and models have two parts: an ontology and a denotation assignment function or naming function.,57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1460,The word ontology comes from the Greek word meaning to be or exist and refers to that branch of philosophy (a subpart of metaphysics) that has to do with the study of what exists in the world or some part of the world.,57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1461,The ontology of the model provides the basis for interpretation in that it defines what exists and so what can be talked about.,57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1462,If something is not recognised as existing in the model then it cannot be referred to or discussed by any language that the model is being used to interpret.,57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1463,"This means, of course, that a model must contain abstract, as well as material, entities, otherwise we could never talk about things like love or virtue, etc. The assumption that abstract things exist just as concrete ones do may seem strange, but the differences between them may be captured by structuring the ontology in different ways.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1464,"For example, it is possible to put different entities (the things that exist) into different sorts according to their basic properties.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1465,A basic distinction can be made between all entities depending on whether they are of an abstract or concrete sort.,57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1466,The semantic properties of the words that are associated with these two sorts of entity may differ from each other in predictable ways.,57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1467,Exactly what sorts of entity should be recognised as making up adequate ontologies for natural language interpretation is a vexed and controversial issue.,57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1468,"Indeed, much current debate in formal semantics centres around just this question.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1469,"The problem will, however, not be addressed in this book.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1470,"The models that are defined in this and later chapters all contain only concrete, physically manifested, entities.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1471,"For present purposes, therefore, it is not necessary to worry about any fundamental differences between the entities in a model.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1472,The important thing that we are concerned with is the relation between the entities in the model and expressions of the language being interpreted.,57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1473,"Once the things that exist in the state-of-affairs being modelled have been determined, it is necessary to associate the basic expressions of the language being interpreted with the entities that constitute the ontology.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1474,"The basic expressions of the object language are here taken to mean the expressions of the language belonging to the major parts of speech (e.g. nouns, verbs, adjectives) in contrast to the grammatical (or functional expressions (e.g. determiners, conjunctions, auxiliary verbs)).",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1475,"In LP, the basic expressions are the individual and predicate constants associated with the nouns, verbs and adjectives of the language being translated in contrast with the purely logical expressions like operators and quantifiers (see later chapters).",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1476,"Logical expressions take their interpretation, not from the model, but from the theory of interpretation, the model theory itself, thus reflecting the fact that such expressions have an invariant interpretation independent of the particular situation being modelled.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1477,"The denotations of constant expressions, however, may change from model to model.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1478,"For example, the name Prudence could be associated with a cat in one model, but a human being in another, or two entities could be singing in one model, but not in another, and so on.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1479,"On the other hand, the equative copula was does not change its function of identifying two entities from situation to situation.",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1480,"Thus, the interpretation",57,39,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1481,"2 Predicates and arguments of a constant expression must be defined for each model, but those of grammatical expressions are fixed by the theory of interpretation.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1482,The association of constants with entities in the model is done by the denotation assignment function.,58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1483,"As discussed in Chapter 1, the denotation of an expression is the relation between the expression and things that exist in the world.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1484,"Since the world for our purposes is given by the model of the world or situation, what is denoted by an expression in Lp is something in the model.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1485,"The denotation of an expression has two aspects: an extension, the sorts of things in the world that an expression can be used to refer to, and an intension, the concept that determines the extension of the expression.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1486,A discussion of the latter aspect of denotation is left until the final four chapters of the book and the semantics defined in Chapters 2 to 6 is purely extensional.,58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1487,"Hence, the denotation assignment functions of the models in these chapters associate each constant in the logic with its extension.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1488,"In the discussion that follows, therefore, the denotation of any expression is given by its extension, and what particular expressions denote are referred to as their extensions.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1489,"The general term denotation is used when talking about the relation between classes of expressions in the object language and the sorts of thing (entities, sets or relations) in the model that those expressions are associated with.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1490,"This latter term is neutral between intension and extension, and, while Chapters 2 to 6 deal only with extensional denotations, what is said about denotation in these chapters is relevant to intensional denotation as it is defined in Chapters 8 to 10.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1491,"Since the relation between a constant (or content word in English) and the entities it denotes is conventional and arbitrary, the denotation assignment function provides the necessary foundation for talking about the entities in the model by specifying precisely what is happening in the situation being modelled.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1492,"For example, consider a simple situation in which there are three entities, a book, a chair and a child, where the latter is sitting on the chair reading the book.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1493,"A model of this situation has an ontology consisting of the three entities involved in it: the book, the chair and the child.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1494,"The denotation assignment function of the model specifies that the English words book, chair and child (extensionally) denote the book, the chair and the child, respectively.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1495,"It also specifies that the transitive verbs read and sit on (extensionally) denote a relation between the child and the book in the first case and the child and the chair in the second and that the verbs sit and read both denote things that the child is doing, and so on.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1496,"Together, the specification of an ontology and an assignment of denotations to basic expressions in a language thus gives a complete description of some state of affairs.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1497,From this complete description we can ascertain the truth or falsity of any formula in the language to be interpreted.,58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1498,How this is done is determined by the model theory which constitutes the second part of the interpretation procedure.,58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1499,This provides a definition of how the denotations of non-basic (i.e. composite) expressions in Lp are to be determined from the denotations of their constituent parts in accordance with the principle of compositionality.,58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1500,"Ultimately, it defines what it is for a formula to be true with respect to some model by specifying the truth-conditions for formulae in Lp.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1501,It thus constitutes the central part of the theory of semantics pursued in this book.,58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1502,"The rest of this chapter is given over to defining a model of a fairly simple (but non-trivial) situation, and providing an informal account of the model theory.",58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1503,The,58,40,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1504,Interpreting LP interpretation procedure thus defined may be used to interpret any formula in LP.,59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1505,"Where these formulae translate sentences generated by d , the procedure provides an indirect interpretation of this fragment of the grammar of English.",59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1506,Individuals and identity,59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1507,"As discussed above, model-theoretic interpretation provides the definition of the truth-conditions of formulae with respect to a model of some state-of-affairs.",59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1508,"In order to interpret Lp, therefore, we must first specify a model and then detail a set of rules for ascertaining the truth or falsity of formulae with respect to this model.",59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1509,"The model defined in this chapter is a very simple one, containing eight entities: two men, two women, a cake, a cat, a dog and a book.",59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1510,"The ontology of this model, called Mi, could thus be represented pictorially as in (25).",59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1511,Using pictures to represent the entities that exist in particular models helps to bring out the way that the theory of semantics presented in this book associates linguistic expressions with non-linguistic objects.,59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1512,"However, they are somewhat inconvenient (and expensive) to have in a textbook and the entities in models will thus be represented using symbols, rather than pictures.",59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1513,"Any symbols may be used to represent these entities, provided only that there is no ambiguity in the symbols used.",59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1514,A unique symbol should thus represent each separate entity in the model.,59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1515,"For example, one might represent the eight entities in M, by using the first eight Arabic positive whole numbers, as in (26.a), or the last eight letters of the Roman alphabet in their uppercase form, as in (26.b).",59,41,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1527,The fact that there are eight different symbols in (26.a) and (26.b) indicates that there are eight different entities in the model whose properties are determined by the denotation assignment function.,60,42,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1528,"However, since the entities in the model M! are two men, two women, a cat, a dog, a book and a cake, it is more convenient for mnemonic purposes to represent these entities by using English words in boldface uppercase letters with subscripts differentiating entities where necessary, as in (27).",60,42,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1529,The English words in upper case letters in (27) are intended to represent actual entities and are not expressions of English.,60,42,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1684,This definition has two important consequences.,63,45,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1689,"However, while {a,b,c} c {a,b,c} is true, {a,b,c} cz {a,b,c} is not, because the two sets contain exactly the same elements.",63,45,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1690,2 Predicates and arguments,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1691,The other result of the definition of subset and superset in (32) is that the empty set is a subset of every set.,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1692,One can see that this must be so by considering what would have to be the case for it not to be a subset of some set.,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1693,"From (32), we deduce that A cannot be a subset of B, if (and only if) there is some element in A that is not in B. Since the empty set contains no members, then it is not possible for it to have a member not in any other set.",64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1694,"Hence, 0 c A is a true statement, whatever set A happens to be.",64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1695,Some sets share members with others without being subsets or supersets of each other.,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1697,"The definition of this relation given in (33) has three important consequences: firstly, where two sets have no common elements, their intersection is the null set, 0 ; secondly, where two sets are identical, their intersection is equal to both sets; and, finally, the intersection of two sets is a subset of them both.",64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1700,"This is known as set union and the union of two sets, A and B, written A u B, is the smallest set containing all the members of both A and B.

1701,The definition of set union in (34) has two consequences: the union of a set with the empty set is the same as the original set; and both sets joined by the union operation are subsets of the resultant set.,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1702,"The union of two sets A and B, A u B, is the set which contains all and only those elements which are in A or which are in B, or both.",64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1703,There is one further property of sets that it is necessary to know at the moment.,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1704,This is a basic assumption of set theory that two sets with the same members are identical.,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1708,Axiom of extension: Two sets A and B are identical iff they have the same members.,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1709,(35) is called an axiom because it is a primitive of set theory and its truth cannot be derived from the truth of other statements in the theory.,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1710,"The term extension has the same meaning as the term discussed above and in Chapter 1 with respect to denotation, i.e. it refers to the elements in a set and not to the property or properties that are common to those elements.",64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1711,"The axiom of extension thus says that whatever name is given to a set and however a set is represented, it is fully defined by the elements it contains.",64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1712,"Therefore, if some set of elements has two names or two different representations, this does not mean that it is two different sets.",64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1713,If two sets have precisely the same members then they are extensionally identical.,64,46,2 Predicates and arguments,,

1718,"This important property is the basis of extensional systems like the semantic theory that is developed in Chapters 2 to 6, but fails in the intensional ones developed in Chapters 8 to 9 (see the discussion in Sections 9.1 and 10.3, in particular).",65,47,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1719,"Until then, however, the Axiom of Extension is assumed to hold and this has two important consequences.",65,47,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1720,"In the first place, (35) entails that sets are unordered.",65,47,2 Predicates and arguments,,
1721,"This means that no matter what order the elements appear in a listed set, provided that the different orderings involve all the same elements, then the differently ordered lists define the same set.",65,47,2 Predicates and arguments,,

2293,This method sets out a truth table giving all the possible combinations of truth and falsity for all the component formulae and showing the truth value of the resultant complex formula containing the appropriate connective.,79,61,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2301,Each combination of truth and falsity is associated with the appropriate truth value for the complex proposition involving the operator or connective.,79,61,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2309,"Thus, to find out the truth value of ~(ethel' - the-golfer'), we need first to determine the truth or falsity of (etheV = the-golfer') with respect to M, by checking whether the expression etheV denotes an entity identical to that denoted by the expression the-golfer' in that model.",79,61,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2314,Negation in L P is recursive and the truth-conditions given in (15) allow the truth value of formulae that contain more than one or two embedded formulae to be computed in a mechanical fashion.,80,62,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2315,"For example, the translation of the sentence // is not the case that the lecturer didn't scream contains two instances of the negation operator, i.e. ~(~(scream'(the-lecturer'))).",80,62,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2620,We end this chapter by providing a more rigorous definition of the theory set up so far.,92,74,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2621,This is primarily concerned with the replacement of informal English as the metalanguage and the definition of models and the theory of interpretation by a more formal language.,92,74,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2622,The metalanguage that is defined in this section is still partly based,92,74,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2623,"Formal interpretation on English, but is much less open to misinterpretation and provides a properly rigorous and unambiguous specification of the whole of the interpretation procedure.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2625,It is to this task that we now address ourselves.,93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2626,"The notation and the points made in this section are of necessity somewhat technical, but no concepts are introduced that have not already been informally presented.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2627,Those unused to formal theories should try not to overreact to the symbolic nature of the formalism.,93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2628,"A symbol is not something mystical or arcane, but a tool to aid analysis and understanding.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2629,"When presented with a string of symbols, readers should take care to recall what each symbol is intended to represent and to assign the symbol the intended interpretation.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2630,"Unlike words or phrases in natural languages, each symbol in a formalism is unambiguous and the pedantry of the metalanguage is designed so that there can be no possibility of ambiguity.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2633,"As we have already seen, there are two parts to the theory of interpretation that we are developing: the construction of models which are the representations of situations or states of affairs, and the theory of interpretation, called the model theory, which provides the means of relating all the expressions in some object language to denotations in these models.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2634,"As discussed in Chapter 2, a model consists of an ontology and a function that assigns extensions to basic expressions in the object language.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2638,"Crucially, F is a function, something that assigns a unique denotation to each constant in the object language.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2639,More is said about functions in,93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2640,"Chapter 4, but their importance lies in the fact that they always provide a unique value (here an extension in the model) for a particular argument (here a basic expression in the object language, LP).",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2641,This ensures that the interpretation of some,93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2642,Lp expression is properly unambiguous.,93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2643,"Thus, F always applies to some constant a in the object language to yield a unique extension, A {delta).",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2644,"If F were not a function, it would be possible for a constant to be assigned two different extensions.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2645,"In such a case, we could not necessarily decide whether a formula involving the expression was true or not and, therefore, could get no information from it.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2646,"For example, if a predicate like scream' denoted two different sets, say 0 and",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2647,"{MANi,WOMAN2},then a formula like scream '(jo') could be either true or false depending on which extension is chosen.",93,75,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2657,"This is because, even if nothing in a model has a certain property or stands in a certain relation to anything else, we can use expressions with null extensions to describe some state of affairs and to make true statements using the negation operator.",94,76,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,
2658,"An expression like Jo threw the cat to Fiona, however, is strictly both ungrammatical and meaningless in the fragment generated by d , because threw is not a word in the lexicon of the grammar.",94,76,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2660,"If this is done, however, its translation into Lp, throw \ must be included in the specification of the denotation function assignment in any model used to interpret LP.",94,76,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2662,"Any model for interpreting expressions in LP can be defined as an ordered pair consisting of the ontology and the denotation assignment function, i.e. M = «A,F».",94,76,3 Negation and Co-ordination,,

2837,Verb phrases and other constituents,100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2838,One of the conditions of adequacy for a semantic theory set up in Chapter 1 is that it conform to the Principle of Compositionality.,100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2839,This principle requires the meaning of a sentence to be derived from the meaning of its parts and the way they are put together.,100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2840,"The interpretation procedure for the grammar fragment set up in the last two chapters adheres to this principle insofar as the translations of sentences, and thereby their interpretations, are derived from the translations of their parts and the syntactic rules used to combine them.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2841,"Thus, for example, the translation of the sentence Ethel kicked the student is derived from the translations of the two noun phrases Ethel and the student and the verb kicked.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2842,"These are combined using the translation rule for transitive sentences to give kick'(etheV,the-student').",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2843,"The truth or falsity of the resulting formula can then be directly ascertained by checking whether the ordered pair of entities denoted by the subject and object in that order is in the set of ordered pairs denoted by the predicate, kick'.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2844,"Unfortunately, in the theory of Chapters 2 and 3, compositionality is maintained only at the expense of the syntax.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2845,"The 'flat' structure of the predicate-argument syntax of Lp and its interpretation requires a flat sentence structure in the English syntax in order to maintain a direct correspondence between syntax and translation, and thus a transparent relation between elements in the interpretation and constituents of the",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2846,English sentence.,100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2847,"There is, however, strong syntactic evidence that many languages, including English, do not have a flat sentence structure, but one that contains a number of hierarchically defined constituents.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2848,"In particular, English sentences are usually analysed as containing verb phrases consisting of the verb and its complements and modifiers.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2849,"According to the principle of compositionality, all constituents within a sentence must have a well-formed translation and thus be assigned a denotation by the model.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2850,"Hence, if the sentence Ethel kicked the student were analysed as containing a verb phrase, a properly compositional semantics would need to assign a logical representation and denotation to the phrase kicked the student.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2851,"It is not too difficult to see what sort of thing such a phrase denotes: verb phrases denote the same things as intransitive verbs, i.e. sets of entities, because the simplest verb phrases consist only of a single intransitive verb.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2852,"Hence, in the same way that the verb ran may be associated with a predicate run' denoting the set of things that have the property of running, so the verb phrase kicked the student ought to be associated with some predicate denoting the set of all entities that kicked the student.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2853,"In formal terms, the extension of this verb phrase should be derived from the extension of predicate representing the verb kick' by taking the first element of each of the ordered pairs in this set where the second element of the pair is the entity denoted by the direct object, [the-student']M in this case.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2854,"There is, however, no expression in LP that could be assigned such an interpretation.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2855,"It is not possible, for example, to represent verb phrases by leaving out the subject expression from a formula.",100,82,4 Type Theory,,
2856,"Expressions like kick'(the-student') or kick'(_,the-student') are not well-formed expressions of LP because they do not conform to the construction rule for formulae given in Chapter",100,82,4 Type Theory,,

2860,"(1) t = Pred n (e\...,e n ).",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2861,"There are also, of course, many other constituents that the logical language L P cannot represent.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2862,"For example, adverbs like slowly or prepositional phrases like in the garden have no obvious representation or interpretation within the theory of the previous chapters.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2863,The word slowly in the sentence Chester ran slowly cannot be treated as a simple predicate because such expressions do not define properties of individuals.,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2864,It makes no sense to translate Chester ran slowly as run'(chester') & slowly'(chester') because the idea of Chester 'being slowly' is not coherent.,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2865,"Even if the adverb were translated as if it were equivalent to its adjectival base form to give run '(chester') & slow '(chester'), this would not provide an adequate interpretation for",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2866,Chester ran slowly.,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2867,"This is because it is Chester's running that is described as slow, not Chester himself.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2868,It is possible that Chester's slow running is still fast and thus to predicate slow of Chester would not capture the meaning intended to be conveyed by the use of the adverb.,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2869,"Adverbs and prepositional phrases (in some of their uses) predicate properties, not of individuals, but of predicates themselves.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2870,"Since LP only contains expressions that are predicates, individuals or connectives, it is not capable of representing higher order concepts like predicates of predicates.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2871,A typed logical language,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2872,There is no way to represent verb phrases or verb phrase modifiers in LP in such a way as to give their intuitively correct denotations.,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2873,A new logical language is therefore needed to represent more adequately the semantic structure of natural languages like English.,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2874,"This logical language must have more flexibility than L P and, in particular, it should have a more complex system of semantic categories, to allow formulae to be given more structure in order to better represent the rich constituent structure of natural languages.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2875,"From now on, we will distinguish logical semantic categories, like e and t, from syntactic ones, like NP, S, etc., by referring to the former as semantic types (or just types).",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2876,The theory behind them is referred to as Type,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2877,Theory and the new logical language is called Ltype.,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2878,"Although L ^ is a very different language from L? in many ways, it contains many of its features.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2879,"In particular, it contains the propositional operators and the notion of predicate/argument structure, albeit in a slightly modified form.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2880,"The interpretation of the language is also similar in that it is based on set theory, although again this is somewhat modified.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2881,We now turn to the definition of the syntax of the language Ltype and see how translation into this language maintains the constituent structure of a sentence.,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2882,Semantic types,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2883,"In Lp, there are only five logical types: individual constant (e), formula (t), one-place connective (i.e. ~), two-place connective (i.e. &, v , —> , <->) and n-place predicate",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2884,(Predn).,101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2885,"These types are all primitive in LP, i.e. they have no internal structure and cannot be further decomposed.",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2886,"It is possible, however, to define them in such a way",101,83,4 Type Theory,,
2887,4 Type theory that only two of the types are primitive and the other three are defined in terms of these.,102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2888,"In order to do this, we must consider a different way of viewing the construction of logical formulae.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,

2898,"In most phrase structure grammars, the combinatorial properties of expressions of particular categories, like e and Predn in (2) (or NP and S in the grammar fragment d ) , have to be inferred from the set of rules that govern their distribution.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2899,"For example, from the grammar fragment G h we can extract the information that transitive verbs combine with two noun phrases to make a sentence or that a conjunction combines with two sentences to make another sentence.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2900,"In the same way, we can think of a two-place predicate as an expression that combines with two individual constants to give a formula, or a connective like & as an expression that combines with two formulae to make a complex formula.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2901,"Such information, however, instead of being encoded within a set of rules, could as well be directly encoded in syntactic categories or semantic types.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2902,"For example, instead of treating a two-place predicate like kick'as having a primitive type, Pred2, we may give it a complex type which itself contains the information that the expression combines with two individuals to make a formula.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2903,Such complex types thus provide information about the number and types of the arguments with which particular expressions combine and the type of the expression that results after the combination.,102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2904,"Hence, the type of an expression directly encodes what other types of expression it can combine with and we only need to know exactly how the combination is effected to perform the required operation.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2905,It is as if we have an equation like that in (3) where we need to replace the e's with particular individual expressions (like etheV and the-student') and to know what the combination operation x means to get to the resulting expression which is a formula of type t.,102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2906,(3) kick' x e x e = t.,102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2907,"Generalising this idea and making it more formal, we can define non-primitive types as ordered pairs of types.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2908,"The first element of the pair indicates the required type of the expression which expressions of the complex type combine with, the input type and the second element gives the type of the resulting expression, the output type.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2909,"Thus, a one-place predicate, like scream\ which combines with an individual expression (an expression of type e) to give a formula (an expression of type t), has the complex type <e,t>.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2910,"Similarly, the negation operator, ~, which combines with a formula to make a formula that has the complex type <t,t>.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2911,"Complex types: <input type,output typo.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2912,"What, however, of expressions that combine with more than one argument, like n-place predicates and two-place connectives?",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2913,"It would be possible to allow types to have an ordered list of types as their first element, instead of just a single type.",102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2914,This list would give the types of all the expressions with which another expression,102,84,4 Type Theory,,
2915,A typed logical language combines and the order in which they are combined.,103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2916,"On this definition, a two-place predicate would have two instances of type e as its input list and t as the type of the output, i.e. have a type <[e,e],t>.",103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2917,"A two-place connective, like &, would have two instances oft as its input and t again as its output, i.e. <[t,t],t> and so on.",103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2918,"It would then be a simple matter to state a rule that combines an expression with a complex type with expressions of all of its input types at the same time: a two-place predicate would combine with two expressions of type e to give a formula (as in the equation in (3)), and a two-place connective would combine with two formulae to give a formula and so on.",103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2919,"This approach would, however, maintain the basic syntax of Lp, since it combines a predicate expression with its argument expressions all in one go.",103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2920,As such it is subject to the same problems in defining representations for constituents like VP as Lp itself.,103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2921,"Instead of defining complex types as having an ordered list as the first element, however, it is possible to restrict the number of input types to one, allowing only binary types and so only binary combination of logical expressions into more complex expressions.",103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2922,This may seem far too strict.,103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2923,"If complex types only have one possible input type, how can n-place predicates be defined?",103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2924,The answer is quite simple.,103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2925,"The types for one-place predicates, <e,t>, and the negation operator, ~, <t,t> have a primitive type, t, as its output type.",103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2926,"The output type could, however, be complex, not primitive.",103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2927,"For example, an expression could combine with an individual constant to give an expression that itself requires an individual constant in order to make a formula.",103,85,4 Type Theory,,
2928,"The type of such an expression would therefore be <e,<e,t» and, since an expression of this type ultimately requires two individual expressions to make a formula, we may associate this type with two-place predicates.",103,85,4 Type Theory,,

3815,The question that must now be addressed is: how to translate/interpret passive verbs to ensure that the rules in (3) yield the appropriate truth-conditions?,131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3816,"If we stick to the rules for translating lexical items that we have been using until now, we should translate passive verbs exactly like their active counterparts, because translation is based on the lexeme underlying the word form.",131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3817,"Given the usual assumption that passive morphology in English is inflectional, the lexeme associated with the formkicked, passive and active past tense, is KICK, so both ought to translate as kick' (as in Chapter 2).",131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3818,"However, if we do this we will end up with the incorrect interpretations for passive sentences: they will come out with different truthconditions from the corresponding active sentences.",131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3819,"To see why this is so, consider the diagram in (4) which represents part of the extension for kick' in the model, M2.",131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3820,"The translation of a sentence like Ethel kicked the dog comes out as true here with the translation of the VP, kick'(the-dog'), having the extension shown by the function f3 which picks out the set of entities kicking the dog, i.e. {MAN!,",131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3821,WOMANi}.,131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3822,"If the passive participle is translated by the expression kick', however, the translation of the corresponding passive The dog was kicked by Ethel comes out as false, because the VP translation, by T17G2, is kick'(ethel') which denotes the function represented by f2, i.e. the characteristic function of the null set.",131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3823,"This, of course, picks out the set of things that kick Ethel, not that kick the dog, but, intuitively, the phrase be kicked by Ethel does not denote this set but the set of things that Ethel kicked.",131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3824,There is unfortunately no way of representing this set in L ^ directly without assigning an extension to the passive participle kicked that is unconnected with that of the active verb kicked.,131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3825,The required function is that shown in (5).,131,113,5 The Lambda Operator,,

3853,"To solve this problem, we need to take another look at sets.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3854,"As we have seen, a set can be specified by listing of all its members or by defining a characteristic function for that set.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3855,"These two methods of defining a set are easy to do if the set being defined is finite, but if the set is not finite but infinite a simple listing is not sufficient because, by definition, the list or the function will never be complete.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3856,"It is possible, however, to define infinite sets by describing in general terms the property that picks out all the members of the set.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3857,"Thus, instead of giving the definition of a set by listing its members, we can give a definition that describes the general property that determines which entities are members of that set.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3858,"For example, the set of all natural numbers is an infinite set for which we can give a partial listing, e.g.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3859,"{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,...} (the three dots before the right hand curly bracket conventionally indicates that the set is open and not fully listed), but we could also describe this set as the set consisting of all the natural numbers.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3860,"Slightly more formally, we can define it as the set of all things that are natural numbers, or more formally still, as the set of all x such thatx is a natural number.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3861,This latter definition selects a variable and specifies a property that any entity substituting for the variable must have in order to be a member of the set in question.,133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3862,"Traditionally, individual variables (i.e. variables ranging over individual entities) are written as lower case members of the end of the alphabet, i.e. x, y, z, which sometimes appear with subscripts, e.g. x b y243, z15, etc., if a large number of such variables are required.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3863,"The intensional description of a set may be symbolised by writing some individual variable before a vertical stroke, I, which both precede a quasi-English expression where the variable takes the place of some noun phrase in the expression, e.g. x is a natural number.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3864,"The resulting expression is enclosed in curly brackets, {•} to indicate that what is being defined is a set.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3865,"So, the set of natural numbers may be defined as fx I x is a natural number}.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3866,"Although this is the most convenient way of specifying an infinite set, we can, of course, use it to specify a finite one.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3867,"For example, we might specify the sets in (6), which are all presumably finite, and which could be used to describe the extensions of the English phrases kicked Chester, was kicked by Jo and was a drunken lecturer, respectively.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,

3880,"Formulae containing variables are semantically incomplete, since variables do not have a fixed interpretation like constants but take their meaning from being associated with specific entities in specific situations, rather like pronouns in natural languages.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3881,"Thus, a formula like (kick'(chester'))(x) does not denote a truth value until the variable, x, is associated with some entity in the model.",133,115,5 The Lambda Operator,,

3891,"The semantic theory developed so far has little to say about intensional things such as properties, but we may instead interpret them extensionally as equivalent to the sets they pick out.",134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3892,"In other words, we may equate the set descriptions in (6) with one-place predicates in L ^ which denote characteristic functions of sets of entities, as we saw in Chapter 4.",134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3893,"Thus, given any entity, a, in some domain, if a substitutes for the variable in a set description to give a true statement, then a is in the set denoted by that description.",134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,

3895,"The propositional functions used at the end of the last section to translate the descriptions in (6) do not, however, denote sets.",134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3896,"They are expressions of type t and not of type <e,t>.",134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3897,"Such expressions can be turned into one-place predicates by the use of a special logical symbol, written X (lambda), called the lambda operator.",134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3898,"This operator picks up, or, more technically, abstracts on, a variable contained in a propositional function and turns the expression into something that denotes a characteristic function.",134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3899,The lambda operator is paired with the variable it abstracts upon which it is said to bind.,134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3900,"For example, Xx abstracts on the x variable and binds all instances of x in some propositional function while Xy abstracts on and binds the y variable, and so on.",134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3901,The operator together with the variable it selects is written to the left of a propositional function which is itself enclosed in square brackets.,134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3902,"For example, given the propositional function (kick'(Chester'))(x) we can form the lambda expression Xx [(kick'(chester'))(x)] which is a well-formed L ^ expression of type <e,t>.",134,116,5 The Lambda Operator,,

3928,"A lambda expression A,x [(()] is thus interpreted as if it were a set-theoretic expression {x I <J>}, extensionally denoting the set of all x such that <|).",135,117,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3929,"For example, the one-place predicate XK [(kick'(chester'))(x)] denotes the set of all x such that x kicked Chester, while the predicate Xy [(kick'(y))(jof)] is interpreted as the set of all y such that Jo kicked y and Xz [drunk (z) & lecturer (z)] denotes the set of all z such that z was drunk and z was a lecturer.",135,117,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3930,"Indeed, because propositional functions are formulae with at least one free variable, ^-expressions can be set-denoting expressions of indefinitely complex internal structure.",135,117,5 The Lambda Operator,,
3931,An expression like Xx [(((loathe'(x))(jof) v (like(x))(joy)) & ((x = the-cakey) -> (eaty(x))(joy)))] is perfectly well-formed in Ltype and denotes the set of all x such that either Jo loathed x or he liked x and if x was the cake then Jo ate x.,135,117,5 The Lambda Operator,,

4016,Interpreting lambda expressions,137,119,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4017,What lambda expressions denote has already been briefly discussed above.,137,119,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4018,"Essentially the idea is that by abstracting on a variable using the lambda operator, an expression is formed that denotes a set, the set of things that have the property specified by the propositional function in the scope of the operator.",137,119,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4019,"So, an expression like Xx [(Ukey(x))(etheV)] denotes the set of things that Ethel liked.",137,119,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4020,It is now time to put this on a more formal footing and specify precisely how the denotation of a lambda expression can be determined from the denotation of the propositional function it is made from.,137,119,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4021,"Although the fundamental idea behind lambda abstraction is a simple one, i.e. that it is a set-forming operator, the formal definition is unfortunately quite complicated, but, as with all formal definitions given in this book, it does no more than restate explicitly the informal definition given earlier.",137,119,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4022,5 The lambda operator,138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4023,"To see how the formal semantics of lambda abstraction works, let us look at what happens in lambda conversion.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4024,The equivalence between <|>* and Xx [ty ] in (10) provides the interpretation of the lambda expression when applied to an appropriate argument.,138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4025,"As we have seen, an expression like Xx[(kick'(x))(jo')](chester') is, by the rule of lambda conversion, equivalent to (kick'(Chester '))(jo')9 i.e. the formula that is obtained when (all occurrences of) the abstracted variable are replaced by the argument expression.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4026,"In yet other words, the truth-conditions of a lambda expression",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4027,Xx [<))] (where <>,138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4028,| is a propositional function containing x) applied to an individual argument a are identical to those of the expression (()* derived by substituting a for all free occurrences of x in ty .,138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4029,From the semantic point of view what this equivalence expresses is that the value of the function denoted by Xx[ty] applied to the denotation of a in a model is identical to that denoted by <|>* in the same model.,138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4030,"This can be more formally represented as (13), but at the moment we have no way of formally expressing what (|>* is, or, more exactly, what its semantics is.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4031,"To do this, the model theory needs to be extended to cope properly with the existence of variables in Ltype expressions.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4032,"[Xx [((>](a)]M if, and only if, [c|)*]M.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4033,"In a number of places in this book, it has been said that variables are like pronouns: if the referent of a pronoun is unknown, there is no way that an expression containing it can be interpreted (assigned a truth value).",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4034,"For example, to know whether She didn 7 like him expresses a true proposition, one has to know who she and him refer to.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4035,"In a similar way, the truth value of a formula containing a variable cannot be ascertained until the variable is associated with some entity in the model.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4036,"In an expression Xx [(|>](a), the lambda operator binding a variable x gives the information that x is to be associated with the entity denoted by a, the argument that the lambda expression applies to.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4037,"For example, Xx [(kicky(x))(jo')](chesterf) is a formula that associates x in the model with [Chester']M2, i.e. DOG.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4038,"On the other hand, the equation of x with DOG is not appropriate for every occurrence of x in any formula, since variables are not uniquely associated with particular entities in any particular model.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4039,"The point of a variable is that it can be associated with different things in different circumstances, unlike constants, whose denotations are fixed by the denotation assignment function of a model.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4040,"The association of variables with entities in a model is something in addition to, and separate from, the model itself.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4041,"Because variables do not have a fixed denotation, they are associated with entities in a model not by the denotation assignment function F, but by a variable assignment function, usually represented by the symbol g.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4042,This function assigns to each variable an entity in the model as its value.,138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4043,"It is usually assumed that the number of variables available is infinite, but of course we are only ever interested in a small number of variables and in particular only the ones appearing in the L^pe expressions we are interpreting.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4044,"Because of this, and because infinite functions pose no real problem in interpretation, we shall ignore all but a very few of the infinite number of variables mentioned in any variable assignment function.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4045,"Formally, then, g is an infinite function but in practice we will deal with only a very small part of it.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4046,"Because the number of variables is infinite, the number of variable assignment functions for any set of entities in a model is infinite and varies quite considerably.",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4047,"For instance, there is a function that maps every variable onto only a single entity",138,120,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4048,"Introducing the lambda operator in the model, one that maps every seventeenth variable onto the same entity or one that maps variables onto entities in strict rotation.",139,121,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4049,These are all perfectly valid functions but not really very useful for our purposes.,139,121,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4050,"The sorts of function we will be dealing with are very restricted, and the only important thing to bear in mind is that because g is a function, every variable is assigned one and only one entity as its value.",139,121,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4051,"From now on, therefore, expressions in L ^ are interpreted with respect not just to a model, M, but also to a variable assignment g.",139,121,5 The Lambda Operator,,
4052,Denotations of expressions are written between square brackets with the names of the model and the variable assignment function as superscripts outside the right bracket:,139,121,5 The Lambda Operator,,

6451,This is illustrated in (6) where the truth of (6.a) presupposes that of (6.b) and where the falsity of (6.b) does not falsify (6.a) as does the falsity of (6.c) (an entailment of (6.a)).,217,199,7 Inference,,

6461,"Implicature is probably the weakest form of inference that can be made, since it holds only where there is no information to the contrary and can be contradicted without contradicting the original sentence.",217,199,7 Inference,,

6725,"So far we have looked at the way inference patterns are constructed from information gleaned from entailments and paraphrases, but conclusions can also be drawn from the use of contradictions.",225,207,7 Inference,,
6726,"The most obvious way that contradictions are used in discourse is to challenge or disprove the truth of other assertions, as exemplified in the simple exchange in (32).",225,207,7 Inference,,

6731,Bertie: But F ve just seen her in the pub.,225,207,7 Inference,,
6732,Jo: Oh dear!,225,207,7 Inference,,
6733,She lied to me.,225,207,7 Inference,,
6734,The reasoning that lies behind this exchange is fairly simple.,225,207,7 Inference,,
6735,Suppose that Fiona has said to Jo that she is working hard on her thesis and so he asserts (32.a) to Bertie.,225,207,7 Inference,,
6736,"On standard assumptions that people generally speak the truth, both Jo and Bertie can infer from this that Fiona is working hard on her thesis is true (let p represent the formula that translates this sentence).",225,207,7 Inference,,
6737,"Bertie, however, has seen Fiona in the pub and asserts (32.b) (call the formula that translates Fiona is in the pub q).",225,207,7 Inference,,
6738,"At this point an unexpressed premiss comes into play to the effect that if someone is in the pub then they are not working hard, from which we can get the formula q -> ~p.",225,207,7 Inference,,
6739,"However, from this and Bertie's assertion, we can infer ~p, via modus ponens.",225,207,7 Inference,,
6740,"This, of course, contradicts the earlier inference p.",225,207,7 Inference,,
6741,"Although this does not contradict (32.a), since",225,207,7 Inference,,
6742,"Fiona did say that she was working hard, Jo can infer that she did not assert p truthfully and his knowledge of lexical meaning allows him to infer that she lied.",225,207,7 Inference,,
6743,"Hence, while Bertie does not directly contradict Fiona's assertion, he provides information that can be used to show that Fiona has been economical with the truth with respect to her working hard on her thesis.",225,207,7 Inference,,
6744,There is another use of contradictory information that involves a form of indirect reasoning called a reductio ad absurdum argument (or negation introduction) by logicians.,225,207,7 Inference,,
6745,"In this form of reasoning, an assumption is made in the course of an inference pattern which is not itself validated by the current premisses.",225,207,7 Inference,,
6746,This assumption is then used to deduce logically that some other sentence is both true and false.,225,207,7 Inference,,
6747,"From this logically false conclusion, it follows that the assumption must be false, since one cannot deduce a false conclusion from a true premiss.",225,207,7 Inference,,
6748,This form of reasoning thus allows one to eliminate different possible explanations; any assumption that leads to a contradiction must be false and so can be discarded.,225,207,7 Inference,,
6749,"This may sound a bit peculiar, but is exemplified in the dialogue in (33) which takes place between Jo and Ethel after Jo has discovered that the poisoned cake has been eaten.",225,207,7 Inference,,

6754,Ethel: F ve just seen him playing with a ball.,225,207,7 Inference,,
6755,Jo: Then who did eat the cake?,225,207,7 Inference,,
6756,7 Inference,226,208,7 Inference,,
6757,"This exchange might seem peculiar because Jo asserts in (33.a) that a certain entity ate the poisoned cake, but in (33.c) asks Ethel who that entity is.",226,208,7 Inference,,
6758,Ethel's response to Jo's initial statement does not directly contradict Jo's statement in (33.a) but she supplies information that when combined with certain unexpressed premisses show that it must be false.,226,208,7 Inference,,
6759,Suppose that Jo finds the plate holding the poisoned cake empty and so concludes that it has been eaten.,226,208,7 Inference,,
6760,"In order to show that this is the case, he must, by the interpretation given to such a sentence, find some entity that ate the cake.",226,208,7 Inference,,
6761,"In logical terms, he must find something that can be associated with the variable z that satisfies the open formula 3x [Vy[cake'(y) & poisoned'(y) <-> JC = y] & eat'(x)(z)].",226,208,7 Inference,,
6762,"He makes a first assumption that Chester is the culprit, but when Fiona makes her assertion in (33.b), he brings to bear three background premisses that show that his assumption must be false.",226,208,7 Inference,,
6763,The first is that if someone has eaten the poisoned cake then they are dead; the second is that if someone is playing with a ball then they are alive; and the third one derives from the meaning of the word alive to the effect that if something is alive then it is not dead.,226,208,7 Inference,,
6764,"From the second of the implicational premisses and Ethel's assertion, we infer, via modus ponens, that",226,208,7 Inference,,
6765,Chester is alive.,226,208,7 Inference,,
6766,"From this conclusion and the third implicational premiss, modus ponens again allows us to infer that Chester is not dead.",226,208,7 Inference,,
6767,"However, from Jo's assumption and the first of the additional premisses, we conclude that Chester is dead.",226,208,7 Inference,,
6768,There is another deduction rule whose validity is intuitively obvious (and provable) that allows us to construct a conjunction from two true formulae (this is often called conjunction introduction).,226,208,7 Inference,,
6769,"Since we have proved that Chester is dead is true and that Chester is not dead is also true, we can infer that Chester is dead and not dead is also true, but a formula of the form p & ~p can never be true.",226,208,7 Inference,,
6770,"Hence, we are forced to conclude that the original assumption, that Chester ate the cake, must be false, since it was this that led to the contradiction.",226,208,7 Inference,,
6771,"Hence, Jo can infer from Ethel's statement that Chester didn't eat the cake so he is none the wiser as to who did and responds with a question.",226,208,7 Inference,,
6772,This somewhat convoluted chain of argument is spelled out in English in (34) and the logical form of the inference pattern is shown in (35).,226,208,7 Inference,,
6773,"Again, in the latter, the rule that licenses each step is given on the right hand side.",226,208,7 Inference,,

6820,"From the assumption of p, i.e. that Chester ate the poisoned cake, we come step by step to the contradictory conclusion in (35.i), i.e. that Chester is and is not dead.",227,209,7 Inference,,
6821,"As we have seen above, a conclusion is truth-conditionally related to its premisses by material implication.",227,209,7 Inference,,
6822,"Hence, we can link the assumption p with the conclusion q & ~q in a conditional expression as in (36.a).",227,209,7 Inference,,
6823,"The creation of an implication combining an assumption with a conclusion reached from that assumption by standard deductive rules is a valid rule of logic, called conditional introduction.",227,209,7 Inference,,
6824,"Because the consequent is a logical contradiction, i.e. it can never be true, the conditional, by the semantics of —>, can only be true if p is false.",227,209,7 Inference,,
6825,"Hence, the generation of a contradiction from an assumption must lead to the conclusion that the original assumption was false (a version of modus tollens).",227,209,7 Inference,,
6826,This is clearly brought out in the conditional English sentence in (36.b) from which it is intuitively necessary to conclude that Chester did not eat the poisoned cake.,227,209,7 Inference,,

6966,"For ~(\/x [(like '(jo '))(x)]) to be false, on the other hand, VJC [(like '(jo f))(x)] must be true, which is so only if every value assigned to x satisfies the propositional function [(like'(jo'))(x)].",230,212,7 Inference,,
6967,"However, we have already seen that for the left hand side of the equivalence to be true there must be at least one value of x that fails to satisfy this open formula, so that we arrive at a contradiction: that there is and is not some value assignment that falsifies",230,212,7 Inference,,

6980,There is one final important point that needs to be made here with respect to the entailments of quantified formulae.,231,213,7 Inference,,

6994,"The truth of (47 .b) and (47.c), on the other hand, follows from the truth of (47.a) by a generalised version of the rule of conjunction elimination given above.",231,213,7 Inference,,
6995,That this inference is valid is shown in (48) which uses a form of inference sometimes called existential elimination.,231,213,7 Inference,,
6996,"Because (48.a) is true (by assumption), there must be some value assignment, g, that satisfies lecturer'(x) & scream'(x) This allows us to infer the truth of a formula where x is replaced by an individual constant that denotes whatever entity is assigned to x by g.",231,213,7 Inference,,

7023,The reason that these inferences cannot be made has to do with the implicational nature of (49.a).,232,214,7 Inference,,
7024,"Since an implication is true whenever its antecedent is false, the formula in (49.a) is true if no value for x satisfies lecturer'(x), i.e. if there is nothing in the extension of lecturer' in some model.",232,214,7 Inference,,

7027,"Furthermore, since there may be no entity that satisfies lecturer '(x) or scream '(x), we cannot even infer that any entities exist at all and so (49.d) also does not follow from the truth of (49.a).",232,214,7 Inference,,

7075,"Moreover, as we saw in (5) above, inferences derived from lexical meaning are weaker than those derived from the interpretations of logical operators, since the former can be suppressed to give rise to non-literal interpretations, while the latter cannot without incoherence.",233,215,7 Inference,,
7076,Content words are much more likely to undergo semantic change over time than grammatical words.,233,215,7 Inference,,

7080,"Moreover, it is a commonplace observation that the vocabularies of different natural languages divide the world in different ways.",233,215,7 Inference,,

7101,Inferences derived from lexical meaning are thus here interpreted as language particular and subject to semantic change (although there are those who would not adopt this position).,234,216,7 Inference,,
7102,"The model-theoretic interpretation of logical expressions, however, captures general aspects of the meaning of grammatical/logical expressions which are, by hypothesis, unchanging and constant across all natural languages all of which have words, morphemes or other ways of indicating these fundamental semantic concepts.",234,216,7 Inference,,
7103,There appears thus to be a considerable difference between the meaning relations that result from the meaning of content words and those that result from the interpretation of the logical operators.,234,216,7 Inference,,
7104,The latter have an invariant interpretation that guides the interpretation of the whole system and thus have their meaning encoded within the model theory itself.,234,216,7 Inference,,

7107,The denotation of a lexeme is its relation to things external to the linguistic system.,234,216,7 Inference,,
7108,"In the theory presented in earlier chapters, it is this aspect of lexical meaning that is paramount and captured by associating each lexeme with the entity, set of entities, etc., of which it is correct to predicate the lexeme.",234,216,7 Inference,,
7109,"This is the extension of the lexeme, which has already been contrasted with its intension and which will be discussed further in Chapters 9 and 10.",234,216,7 Inference,,
7110,"The sense of a lexeme, on the other hand, has a number of different interpretations within the philosophical and linguistic literature on linguistic meaning.",234,216,7 Inference,,
7111,"Some philosophers, like Montague following Frege and Carnap, interpret sense in the way that intension will be interpreted in later chapters, as a logical function that determines the extension of an expression (basic or derived) in different situations (see Chapters 9 and 10).",234,216,7 Inference,,
7112,"Many linguists, on the other hand, interpret sense in a relational way as concerned only with",234,216,7 Inference,,
7113,Lexical meaning the set of meaning relations lexemes bear to other lexemes (or expressions) within a particular language.,235,217,7 Inference,,
7114,There seems some benefit in maintaining a distinction between these two notions (see Chapter 10) and so it is the latter interpretation of sense that is used here.,235,217,7 Inference,,
7115,"In other words, the notion of sense is to be defined in terms of the different of sense relations that hold between lexemes in a language.",235,217,7 Inference,,
7116,"Many different types of sense relations have been recognised between the words and expressions in a language, some of which are central to the linguist's notion of sense.",235,217,7 Inference,,
7117,"One important sense relation is that of hyponymy where the sense of one lexeme, the hyponym, is included in that of another, the superordinate, and the extension of the former includes that of the latter (e.g. rose and flower).",235,217,7 Inference,,
7118,"The relation of synonymy is defined where two lexemes have the same sense and extension, and so may be defined as mutually hyponymous.",235,217,7 Inference,,
7119,"Total synonymy is rare (an example may be quicksilver and mercury, although the former term is now archaic), but partial synonymy occurs relatively frequently where two lexemes have almost the same sense and almost the same extension (e.g. pullover and jumper or sweater in British",235,217,7 Inference,,
7120,English).,235,217,7 Inference,,
7121,"On the other hand, two lexemes are described as opposites if their extensions are required to be distinct and their senses are contradictory with respect to each other.",235,217,7 Inference,,
7122,There are a number of specific types of opposites.,235,217,7 Inference,,
7123,Antonymy (in the restricted sense of this term) covers gradable opposites like hot/cold.,235,217,7 Inference,,
7124,"Gradable antonyms form instances of contraries (see below) and implicitly or explicitly invoke a field over which the grading takes place, i.e. a standard of comparison.",235,217,7 Inference,,
7125,"So, for example, the adjective tall changes its extension according to the properties of the entities of which it is predicated (e.g. tall gerbil vs. tall giraffe).",235,217,7 Inference,,
7126,Complementaries,235,217,7 Inference,,
7127,"(or binary antonyms) are all non-gradable opposites which, from the extensional point of view, divide the universe of discourse into two disjoint sets (e.g. dead vs.",235,217,7 Inference,,
7128,alive and abstract vs. concrete).,235,217,7 Inference,,
7129,The last opposite relation is that of the contraries which involve the general opposition sense relation but without the negation of one of the lexemes implying the truth of the other (thus excluding contradictories).,235,217,7 Inference,,
7130,"We can use this term to refer to non-binary contrasts found among co-hyponyms like peony, rose, tulip, etc or ranks (e.g. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.).",235,217,7 Inference,,
7131,"Finally, there are three more general sense relations that involve more complex properties of the arguments of predicates.",235,217,7 Inference,,
7132,The first is that of the selectional restrictions that predicates impose on their arguments.,235,217,7 Inference,,
7133,"For example, the verb kick requires an animate (and legged) subject and a concrete direct object while the verb solve requires an animate and usually human subject and an abstract object (e.g. The child solved the problem versus IThe rock solved the problem versus IThe student solved the chair).",235,217,7 Inference,,
7134,"Next, we have converses which are relational terms where the relation denoted by one lexeme is reversed to give the relation denoted by another",235,217,7 Inference,,

7140,"Finally for our purposes, the meaning of lexemes may be related by decomposition to the meanings of expressions involving fundamental notions like causality (e.g. if x kills y then x causes y to die) or change of state (e.g.",235,217,7 Inference,,

7144,The important question is thus how to capture the sense relations within truth-conditional semantics.,236,218,7 Inference,,
7145,"The theory of semantics that has been adopted here gives primacy to sentence meaning over lexical meaning, or, more precisely, to the interpretation of the formulae that translate sentences rather than to the interpretation of constants.",236,218,7 Inference,,
7146,"Until now, the semantic contribution of words has been restricted to the contribution they make to the truth-conditions of every sentence in which they can appear.",236,218,7 Inference,,
7147,"Since content lexemes are translated (and interpreted) as constants in the logical representation of a sentence, this makes their extension their primary contribution to the meaning of a formula.",236,218,7 Inference,,
7148,"Given that, in truth-conditional semantics, the central aspect of the meaning of an expression is taken to be its denotation, one may think of sense relations as specifying relations between the extensions of different lexemes and expressions.",236,218,7 Inference,,
7149,"For example, tulip and rose are both hyponyms of flower which means that every tulip and every rose is a flower or, more formally, that the extensions of the predicates tulip' and rose' are subsets of the extension offlower'.",236,218,7 Inference,,
7150,"Furthermore, rose and tulip are opposites (incompatible cohyponyms) and so their extensions are disjoint.",236,218,7 Inference,,
7151,"Thus, the sense of a lexeme may be defined as the constraints it imposes on the extensions of other expressions with respect to its own extension.",236,218,7 Inference,,
7152,"The meaning of a lexeme in truth-conditional semantics can thus be defined in terms of both its extension and its sense relations, as in (55).",236,218,7 Inference,,
7153,Lexical meaning: The meaning of a lexeme is the contribution it makes to the truth or falsity of the proposition expressed by any sentence in which it can appear together with the constraints it imposes on the extensions of other expressions in those sentences.,236,218,7 Inference,,
7154,Defining sense relations in terms of constraints on the denotations of expressions allows them to be given a representation in LQ and thus a transparent interpretation within the theory.,236,218,7 Inference,,
7155,It is common within lexical semantics to identify the sense relations of particular lexemes by inserting a lexeme into a particular sentence frame and seeing whether the sentence so formed appears to be tautologous.,236,218,7 Inference,,
7156,"For example, to test for hyponymy, the hyponymous lexeme is substituted for X and its superordinate for Y in the sentence frame Every X is a Y. Thus, the tautologous feel of Every tulip is a flower indicates the hyponymy between tulip andflower whereas the sentence No tulip is a rose indicates the incompatibility between tulip and rose and so on.",236,218,7 Inference,,
7157,Such sentences have a simple and direct translation into formulae in LQ as in (56) where,236,218,7 Inference,,
7158,(56.a) requires the set of all tulips to be a subset of the set of all flowers and (56.b) requires the set of tulips to have a null intersection with the set of roses.,236,218,7 Inference,,

7163,Formulae like those in (56) are called meaning postulates and have the form of statements in the logical metalanguage that specifically relate formulae containing different logical constants which translate particular lexemes and other expressions.,236,218,7 Inference,,
7164,Meaning postulates all have the form of an implication where the antecedent consists of a formula constructed from a single constant whose argument places are bound by universal quantifiers.,236,218,7 Inference,,
7165,The consequent of the implicational statement is a more or less,236,218,7 Inference,,
7166,Lexical meaning complex formula consisting of related constants at least one of whose argument places contains a bound variable shared with the antecedent and whose other argument places are either existentially or universally bound.,237,219,7 Inference,,

7169,(57.a) relates the extension of kill' to that of cause to die; (57.b) allows the inference from Someone caused something to occur to the fact that something did occur; (57.c) relates dying and becoming dead and (57.d) relates the extensions of dead and alive.,237,219,7 Inference,,

7344,conclusion,241,223,7 Inference,,
7345,The formal interpretation of a connective like 4- will not be further pursued as there is much more to the retrieval of lexical inferences than just setting up meaning postulates containing such an implicational connective.,241,223,7 Inference,,
7346,"In particular, pragmatics",241,223,7 Inference,,
7347,(mainly in the guise of cognitive relevance) must come into play in examples like,241,223,7 Inference,,
7348,"(69) to explain why, for example, it is a bachelor's maleness that is suppressed rather than a woman's non-maleness (i.e. it is the inference derived from bachelor that is altered, not that derived from woman).",241,223,7 Inference,,
7349,"Furthermore, the notion of sense put forward here allows a distinction to be made between sentences and situations in terms of how",241,223,7 Inference,,
7350,"7 Inference few or how many lexical inferences need to be suppressed to avoid contradiction, but this requires more semantic machinery than is yet available.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7351,(But see Chapters 9 and,242,224,7 Inference,,
7352,10 for some further discussion of the matter.),242,224,7 Inference,,
7353,"For these reasons, a proper formalisation of the way meaning postulates work will not be spelled out here.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7354,"It is unfortunate that while lexical semantics has, at least until very recently, been the primary focus of linguistic semantics, a great deal of work remains to be done on this topic within logical semantics.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7355,"It does, however, seem a reasonable hypothesis that central aspects of lexical meaning can be analysed in terms of the definition of sense relations as constraints on the denotations of expressions within a particular language.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7356,"It also seems reasonable that such constraints cannot be stated as part of the model theory (as conditions on admissible models), if their comparative weakness with respect to the logical operators is to be captured.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7357,"Thus, however the formal procedure for making inferences from meaning postulates is to be set up, these two points must be incorporated.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7358,Non-truth-conditional aspects of the connectives,242,224,7 Inference,,
7359,"In this last section, we take a look at some aspects of the meaning of sentences containing the conjunctions and, or and if ..then that are not explained by the truth-conditional interpretation of their logical counterparts, &, v and —».",242,224,7 Inference,,
7360,This discussion is by no means exhaustive and there are aspects of the meanings of the connectives that are not discussed.,242,224,7 Inference,,
7361,"The point of this section, however, is to indicate how inference patterns can be constructed to account for certain aspects of meaning not determined by truth-conditional interpretation by considering language use.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7362,"The success of this enterprise provides support for the hypothesis that truth-conditional semantics can provide a sufficient basis for a general theory of meaning, as long as it is supplemented by a rich enough theory of pragmatics.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7363,And,242,224,7 Inference,,
7364,"First, let us look at the semantics of sentences containing and.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7365,As discussed in,242,224,7 Inference,,
7366,"Chapter 3, the truth-conditions of a formula containing the connective & are met if, and only if, both conjunct formulae are true.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7367,"This holds irrespective of the order in which the conjunct formulae appear, because & is a commutative operator, as we have already seen.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7368,The sentence in (71.a) is thus truth-conditionally equivalent to that in,242,224,7 Inference,,
7369,(71.b).,242,224,7 Inference,,
7370,(71) a.,242,224,7 Inference,,
7371,b.,242,224,7 Inference,,
7372,"The skier fell over and broke her ankle,",242,224,7 Inference,,
7373,The skier broke her ankle and fell over.,242,224,7 Inference,,
7374,"Most speakers of English, however, would interpret an utterance of (71 .a) as meaning something different from an utterance of (71.b).",242,224,7 Inference,,
7375,"This is because there is a tendency to assume that conjuncts are causally or temporally related, if the events described are such that they can be so related under normal assumptions.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7376,"In (71 .a), for example, the sentence The skier fell over comes before (she) broke her ankle and so the most likely interpretation is that the falling preceded, and possibly caused, the breaking of the ankle.",242,224,7 Inference,,
7377,"This temporal/causal relation is reversed in (71.b) where the order of the constituent clauses are reversed: the skier's breaking her leg precedes, and possibly",242,224,7 Inference,,
7378,"Non-truth-conditional aspects of the connectives causes, her falling over.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7379,This difference between (71.a) and (71.b) could be taken as an indication of the incorrectness of the semantic interpretation provided for the conjunction and by the truth table for &.,243,225,7 Inference,,
7380,"To establish whether or not this is so, we have to ask ourselves a few questions: is the temporal/causal relation between two conjoined clauses found between clauses in other contexts?",243,225,7 Inference,,
7381,"If it is, can a unified treatment of the two constructions be proposed without invoking the semantics of the conjunction?",243,225,7 Inference,,
7382,We must also ask whether the causal/temporal implication always holds of conjoined clauses and finally whether it is possible for two conjoined clauses to translate into a true formula if the truth-conditions provided for and are not met.,243,225,7 Inference,,
7383,The answer to the first question is quite straightforward: exactly the same temporal/causal effect is found when two or more sentences are strung together in a text without any overt co-ordinating morpheme.,243,225,7 Inference,,
7384,"Thus, the simple text in (72.a) appears to be more coherent than that in (72.b) where the order of the sentences is changed, despite the fact that they could both be said to describe the same situation.",243,225,7 Inference,,

7396,Bertie gave the cake to the dog.,243,225,7 Inference,,
7397,"The peculiarity of the text in (72.b) may be, at least in part, ascribed to the fact that texts of this sort are taken to describe a series of events occurring in the order in which the sentences appear.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7398,"Imposing such a temporal order on (72.b), however, makes it difficult to construct a sensible causal chain out of the events and so it appears incoherent.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7399,Temporal and causal order is thus imposed on a series of non-conjoined sentences forming a text as well as on conjoined sentences.,243,225,7 Inference,,
7400,This strongly suggests that this aspect of the meaning of conjunctions has nothing to do with the meaning of the word and but with the way texts are constructed.,243,225,7 Inference,,
7401,"This hypothesis is confirmed by the fact that situations can be presented (and often are, in practice) with later events being described before earlier ones.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7402,"Furthermore, the causal/temporal implications of and are not always in evidence.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7403,"For example, sentences like The skier broke her ankle and the instructor cracked his ribs and Jo's aunt is insane and his grandfather was in jail for many years do not imply that the situations described by each of the conjuncts is connected causally or temporally.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7404,"On the other hand, it is never possible for a conjoined sentence to describe a true state of affairs when one of its component sentences describes something actually false.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7405,"So for example, it is perfectly possible for (71 .a) and (71 .b) to describe the same temporal state of affairs, but it is not possible for such a statement to be true, if, in fact, the skier did not break her ankle.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7406,"Thus, the temporal/causal effects associated with conjunction can be cancelled or weakened and appear in other textual situations which do not contain and, whereas the truth of each conjunct cannot be denied without denying the truth of the whole sentence.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7407,"This is evidence, therefore, that the truth-conditions for & provide the central core of the meaning of and while temporal and causal effects are secondary and can be explained by a theory of language use.",243,225,7 Inference,,
7408,7 Inference,244,226,7 Inference,,
7409,Or,244,226,7 Inference,,
7410,"A similar argument may be applied to one of the apparent oddities in the truthconditions associated with or via its translation as logical disjunction, as discussed in Chapter 1.",244,226,7 Inference,,
7411,"Because of the truth-conditions of v, a disjunctive formula may be true if both of the disjuncts are true.",244,226,7 Inference,,
7412,"However, in English, the use of a disjunctive sentence often implies that only one of the disjuncts is true.",244,226,7 Inference,,
7413,"It would, for example, be extremely odd for someone to utter the sentences in (73) knowing that both disjuncts are true.",244,226,7 Inference,,

7417,Bertie's jacket was in the bedroom or in the cloakroom.,244,226,7 Inference,,
7418,Although the truth-conditional interpretation of or allows both sentences in (73) to be true of situations in which Fiona was a professorial Dean of the Arts Faculty and,244,226,7 Inference,,
7419,"Bertie's jacket was both in the bedroom and in the cloak-room, these statements would not usually be given such an interpretation.",244,226,7 Inference,,
7420,"Very often disjunctive sentences have an exclusive meaning, i.e. one which disallows situations where both disjuncts are true.",244,226,7 Inference,,

7455,"Because of sentences like those in (76), we cannot take exclusive disjunction as basic because otherwise the formulae that translate such examples would be false where both disjuncts are true; an undesirable consequence, as we have seen.",245,227,7 Inference,,
7456,"If we assume that inclusive disjunction is basic, however, we can show that the exclusivity effects result from non-truth-conditional aspects of meaning.",245,227,7 Inference,,
7457,There are two major sources for exclusive readings of disjunctions.,245,227,7 Inference,,

7460,"A sentence like Bertie ys jacket is in the bedroom or on the floor, however, can be given an inclusive reading, because the properties of being on the floor and being in a bedroom are not mutually exclusive.",245,227,7 Inference,,

7470,The relevant maxim is repeated in (79):,246,228,7 Inference,,
7471,Maxim of quantity: Make your exchange as informative as is required.,246,228,7 Inference,,
7472,"Amongst other things, the maxim of quantity requires speakers to use a conjunction if they believe that two sentences express true propositions or to state that two disjoined sentences may both be true.",246,228,7 Inference,,

7487,"The truth-conditions for v guarantee that a complex formula p v q is true if p is true, irrespective of the truth value of the other component formula.",246,228,7 Inference,,

7503,If,247,229,7 Inference,,
7504,There are a number of peculiar things about the interpretation of conditional sentences as logical material implication.,247,229,7 Inference,,
7505,One of these is the peculiarity of asserting conditional sentences when there appears to be no apparent causal relation between the antecedent and the consequent.,247,229,7 Inference,,

7516,"If the cake was poisoned, then the dog is a space alien from Alpha Centauri.",247,229,7 Inference,,
7517,The acceptability of the sentences in (81) declines from (81 .a) to (81 .e) as it becomes more difficult to connect the situation described by the antecedent with that described by the consequent.,247,229,7 Inference,,
7518,This feeling of connectivity between the two sentences is much stronger with conditionals than with conjunctions and is not so easily accounted for,247,229,7 Inference,,
7519,"(particularly as material implication is not commutative, i.e. p —> q is not truthconditionally equivalent to q —> p).",247,229,7 Inference,,
7520,"However, we can again provide a pragmatic explanation for this phenomenon using Gricean principles of conversation.",247,229,7 Inference,,
7521,"The explanation utilises the maxim of quantity in (79) and the maxim of quality, repeated in (82).",247,229,7 Inference,,
7522,Maxim of quality: Do not say what you believe to be false and do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.,247,229,7 Inference,,
7523,"To see how these maxims help explain the gradation of acceptability in (81), consider what one is trying to convey in asserting a conditional sentence.",247,229,7 Inference,,
7524,"In general, the utterance of a conditional sentence asserts that, as far as the speaker is aware, it is not true that the antecedent is true and the consequent is false simultaneously, i.e.",247,229,7 Inference,,
7525,the maxim of quality is adhered to by avoiding the assertion of something known to be false.,247,229,7 Inference,,
7526,"For listeners to believe such a conditional, they should be able to pick out a connection between the two clauses that enables them to be certain that their truth-conditions are met.",247,229,7 Inference,,
7527,If there is no such connection then they could believe the formula expressed by the conditional only by having reasonable grounds for believing that the antecedent is false or the consequent true.,247,229,7 Inference,,
7528,"By the maxim of quantity, however, the speaker is then revealed as being un-co-operative because he or she should either have simply stated the consequent or denied the truth of the antecedent.",247,229,7 Inference,,
7529,"The conditional says too much, as it were.",247,229,7 Inference,,

8180,"The perfective, then, may be (and often is) treated as the semantically neutral aspect, without any need for an operator (like the tense operators, Pres, Past and Fut).",270,252,"8 Time, Tense and Aspect",,

8186,"Furthermore, it could be argued that the completeness property of the perfective should be represented in its semantics.",270,252,"8 Time, Tense and Aspect",,
8187,This may be done by requiring the temporal interval at which the truth of a perfective formula is assessed to contain both initial and final moments of the event being described by the sentence.,270,252,"8 Time, Tense and Aspect",,
8188,This would mean that the proposition expressed by a sentence like Jo kicks Chester would be true only if the event of Jo's kicking Chester is begun and finished at the time of utterance.,270,252,"8 Time, Tense and Aspect",,

8192,"In the future tense, such an analysis would entail that the initial moment of the event being described must follow the time of utterance.",270,252,"8 Time, Tense and Aspect",,

8197,The requirement for initial and final points applies only to predicates that inherently contain them.,270,252,"8 Time, Tense and Aspect",,

8664,The philosopher Gottlob Frege was the first to tackle this problem directly.,285,267,9 Possible Worlds,,
8665,He proposed that a distinction should be made between what he called the reference (German,285,267,9 Possible Worlds,,
8666,Bedeutung) of an expression and its sense (German Sinn).,285,267,9 Possible Worlds,,
8667,"The reference of an expression is what we have been calling its extension, that is the entity or function that an expression refers to in any model.",285,267,9 Possible Worlds,,
8668,"Its sense, on the other hand, is more abstract, more like the 'meaning' of the expression.",285,267,9 Possible Worlds,,

8675,"In either case, both intension and extension are intended to refer to things in the world and so constitute different aspects of the denotation of an expression, according to the definition of this concept in Chapter 1.",285,267,9 Possible Worlds,,
8676,"This distinguishes both terms from sense, which is, from the linguistic point of view, language internal and defines the meaning relations between words and expressions of a particular language, as we saw in Chapter 7.",285,267,9 Possible Worlds,,
8677,"We may thus picture the 'meaning' of an expression as minimally constructed from its sense and its denotation, as shown in the diagram in (11).",285,267,9 Possible Worlds,,

8684,Making a distinction between extensional and intensional denotation allows a distinction to be made between referentially transparent and referentially opaque contexts.,286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,
8685,"In the former case, a predicate is interpreted as a function over the extensional type of its argument, in the way familiar from previous chapters.",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,
8686,"Predicates that create opaque contexts, however, can be interpreted as denoting functions that take the intensional type of their arguments as their domain.",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,
8687,"Thus, while the verb meet denotes a relation between two entities, the verb look for denotes a relation between an entity, the searcher, and the intension (or concept) of another.",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,
8688,"In this way, we can distinguish the meanings of the sentences Bertie is looking for an elf and Bertie is looking for a hobbit.",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,
8689,"The expressions elf and hobbit, we assume, extensionally denote the null set in the actual world, and hence the noun phrases an elf and a hobbit also both denote the null set (since no set has a non-null intersection with 0).",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,
8690,"Their intensions, on the other hand, differ, since the property that identifies an entity as an elf differs from that which identifies a hobbit, even though there are no actual elves or hobbits picked out in the real world and so if Bertie actually found one he would be able to identify it as such.",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,
8691,"Similarly, verbs like believe do not denote relations between entities and truth values, the extensions of sentences, but relations between entities and the intensions of sentences, which may be informally interpreted as the propositions they express.",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,
8692,"To believe that the Morning Star is the planet Venus is, therefore, not the same as believing that the Evening Star is the planet Venus because the propositions expressed by these two sentences differs.",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,

8695,"Because the intensions of these sentences differ, Jo can 'stand in a belief relation' to one and not the other without contradiction, even if it is contingently true that the Evening Star and the Morning Star extensionally denote the same entity.",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,

8697,Principle of Compositionality.,286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,
8698,"If the denotation of an expression can only be extensional, then the examples in Section 9.1 constitute a direct refutation of this principle, because the meaning of the whole does not rely on the extensions of the complements of the main verbs.",286,268,9 Possible Worlds,,

8702,Frege attributed another important property to his concept of intension (Sinn) which is stated as the Principle ofIntensional Reference in (13).,287,269,9 Possible Worlds,,
8703,This captures the traditional principle that intension (the defining property of some class) determines extension (the membership of a class).,287,269,9 Possible Worlds,,
8704,Principle of Intensional Reference: There is a relation between intensions and extensions such that each intension determines a unique extension.,287,269,9 Possible Worlds,,
8705,The idea that an intension determines a unique extension for some expression allows the concept to be defined in terms of a function.,287,269,9 Possible Worlds,,
8706,"The intension of an expression is the property that unifies all the members of its extension, and so it enables the identification of the extension to take place.",287,269,9 Possible Worlds,,

10245,A second problem for the theory of intension defined in this chapter has to do with the interpretation of proper names.,337,319,10 Intensional Semantics,,
